      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        The significance of the mantra is in the prayer for the right thoughts to come at the right time, so they can be followed by right action. It is believed that when we start living a life in alignment with our intuition, the actions we take turn out to be in our best interest.

      <p className='font-bold text-lg text-center'>What is the importance of chanting?</p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       When someone abuses you verbally, how do you feel? If someone says that you are a donkey, how do you feel? What does it do to you? What does it create? Anger! It shakes you. It creates some negative vibrations; you feel angry. You feel some sensations in the stomach, in the head. If a bad word can create so much physiological reactions in you, do you think a very sweet name, a chant, which includes a lot of energy of the cosmos does not do anything to your body?
It is unscientific and stupid to think that a mantra does not do anything to your body. That is not the case! It does. That is why it is called mantra kavach(armour); a mantra creates the sense of an armour around your body. Sometimes you meet some people and you feel like talking to them. You get good vibes from them. Sometimes you
meet people and you want to avoid them. Do you know why? The negative vibes around a person make them repulsive. Mantras turn around these negative, repulsive vibrations, into more positive and attractive vibrations. This is the advantage of mantra chanting.

       <br />
Your whole body is made up of atoms. Being with this truth kindles the energy in you and brings up the consciousness. When you sing bhajans, the Sound Energy Vibration Gets Absorbed into Every Particle of Your Body. Just like a microphone absorbs sound and converts it into electricity, the body absorbs the vibrations and converts it into consciousness.
When you sit in bhajans your entire body gets soaked in energy and transformation happens. If you are sitting and listening to gossip or violent music, then that gets absorbed by your body and does not give a nice feeling. When you hear the Knowledge, or chant with all your heart, that elevates your consciousness. There is an ancient proverb in Sanskrit which says that the words of rishis and enlightened ones are translated into experience immediately.
We have read and heard from so many people, but when Guruji speaks the same knowledge it straight-away hits home.

<br />
If you have been initiated into any mantra, at least few times every day, you must chant. It's like watering a plant. So, few times you can chant the mantra. The mantra chanting happens before meditation, after meditation, you can chant before having food. Chanting those mantras create different energy. Mantras sprout in the space and they energize you. So, it's also called mantra snān. Listening to the mantra being played or chanting both acts as a mantra shower that is the shower for the mind. It strengthens the inner powerful energy that you are.
For example :
<br />
1) the laugh of a baby or words of praise can produce a pleasant state of mind.
<br />
2) the sound of a wild animal while hiking in the woods or hateful words thrown at us by a stranger can
produce fear and unsettled emotions.
<br />
3) when you go for any Panchakarma treatment – the practitioner always chants before starting, invoking
Dhanvantari, the lord of Ayurveda, the celestial healer.
<br />
4) what do people chant in a Palkhi procession? – Vithal Vithal. Chanting a single word repetitively with faith & shraddha gives them immense strength.
<br />
5) when you watch a mythological movie – the one moment which give you goosebumps are the songs, which
is nothing but chanting names of gods.

      <p className='font-bold text-lg text-center'>What are mantras?</p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
      Mantras are powerful sound vibrations that reverberate in human consciousness.
“Mantras are impulses or rhythms of consciousness,” says Bhanu Maa. “They create vibrations in the spirit. Their effects, influence, method and mode of working are all a mystery.”
In Sanskrit, it is said, <span className='font-bold text-red-400'>Manana trayate iti mantra.</span>
“Mantra is that which saves you from repetitiveness. A repetitive thought is a worry. Mantras help free you from your worries”
<span className='font-bold'>Why we chant sounds without understanding their meaning? Can something beyond our understanding help us?</span>
The meaning of every mantra is infinity. It is a sound vibration beyond the cognition of the mind. When the mind is unable to cognize, it simply dissolves and moves into a meditative space.

      </p>
      <p className='font-bold text-lg text-center'>Forms of Mantras</p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-center">
     Mantras are essentially of three types: Kirtan or bhajan, chanting, and japa.
     <br />
1. When we chant mantras loudly and together in a group, it is called kirtana (or bhajan where bhaj means to
share—sharing the one consciousness).
<br />
2. When we recite in a normal or medium tone of the voice, then it is called chanting.
<br />
3. When you recite quietly or very slowly in the mind, then that is called japa.
      </p>
      <p className='font-bold text-lg text-center'>What does the research say?</p>
