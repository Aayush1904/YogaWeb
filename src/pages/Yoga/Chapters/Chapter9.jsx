परमाणु परममहत्त्वान्तोऽस्य वशीकारः ॥ ४०॥

One gains control over the smallest as well as the largest.
</span>
What happens when you go inwards? You gain the ability of vastness and subtlety.

Parama-mahattva means the vastness of consciousness. You realise that the nature of consciousness is vast and at the same time very subtle. It is smaller than the smallest and bigger than the biggest. This experience comes to you when the mind becomes stable, calm and serene.

When you are sad and upset, when your mind is all over the place , you feel neither the expansion nor the subtlety of consciousness .But when your mind is calm, you experience the most delicate and the subtlest aspect of your consciousness and also the vastness of the consciousness. You experience both. Then you are able to influence the tiniest aspect of your consciousness and the largest manifestation of it.

क्षीणवृत्तेरभिजातस्येव मणेर्ग्रहीतृग्रहणग्राह्येषु तत्स्थतदञ्जनतासमापत्तिः ॥ ४१ ॥</span>

When the modulations of the mind are diminished, it becomes like a polished transparent crystal and alignment (samāpattih) is established between the perceiver, perception and the object of perception.

If you keep a crystal in front of you and focus a light on it, the crystal will reflect, radiate the light and it will assume the colour of the light also. In the same way, when our consciousness becomes crystal clear, it is able to perceive things with much more clarity than before. The perceiver, the perception and the object that it perceives, all the three dimensions of the one consciousness come into play. When you are moving in a car, so many cars are reflected in the side mirror. Do any of the images leave an imprint on the mirror? No! When your mind has inner stability, then nothing stays there. Your mind becomes like a mirror, like a crystal. This is samāpattih.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       Just like the crystal that remains unstained while reflecting and holding the light, the pure mind reflects the objects of perception and yet does not get stained with them.

When the mind is not that pure, the stain of all the events or the sceneries or objects on the mind becomes its karma. Suppose an image gets imprinted in a mirror, it is its karma. But if the mirror is clean and it just reflects the image, nothing gets imprinted, that is samāpattih.

No doubt the object is being reflected in the mirror, but the mirror does not hold onto the object. Similarly, though the consciousness perceives everything more clearly, nothing stays on or sticks to it. That is samāpattih.

It's like a child's smile. One moment the child is angry, the next moment it is smiling. But when you get upset, it probably takes several days to pull yourself out of it. When the consciousness becomes very clear and pure, you enjoy everything in the world much more than before. Every flower appears to be more beautiful, all colours appear to be brighter, and every bit of water you drink appears to be tastier. So, every move of your life is enhanced with bliss. Yet no cravings for it will ever get imprinted on the mind. That is samāpattih.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>tatra śabda-artha-jñāna-vikalpaiḥ sańkīrņā savitarkā samāpattih || 42 ||

तत्र शब्दार्थज्ञानविकल्पैः संङ्कीर्णा सवितर्का समापत्तिः ॥ ४२॥</span>

That state when the gap between the word, its meaning and its experience, becomes insignificant, is called savitarkā samāpatti- alignment with a special logic.

In this state of equanimity, words, meanings, and experiences are still there. Though there is engrossment, it is savitarkā. It contains a logical, sequential understanding.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>smrti-pariśuddhau svarūpa-śūnya-iva-artha-mātra-nirbhāsā nirvitarkā || 43 ||

स्मृतिपरिशुद्धौ स्वरूपशून्येवार्थमात्रनिर्भासा निर्वितर्का ॥ ४३॥</span>

When the memory (latent impressions) is purified, the 'T' seems as if void and only 'am' of the 'I am' exists. That is called nirvitarkā samāpatti.

      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Vitarka is when you ask, "Who am I?" Nirvitarkā is when you are not even asking the question. When your memory of who you are , is crystal clear then your memory has deepened. You know this life is only a part of a stream of lives that we have had on this planet, "My consciousness, 'I am', has gone through various bodies but I am not this or any of these identities." That state of mind which is devoid of even thoughts and is just a presence is called nirvitarkā samādhi. Savitarkā means there is an understanding, a thought. Nirvitarkā means only the presence exists, there is no thought. Sometimes in deep meditation, you experience that you 'are' but you don't know where you are, who you are, nothing! You are not aware of anything else, just this presence 'I am' that is all. That is called nirvitarkā samādhi.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>etayā-iva savicārā nirvicārā ca sūkṣma-viṣayā vyākhyātā || 44 ||

एतयैव सविचारा निर्विचारा च सूक्ष्मविषया व्याख्याता ॥ ४४॥</span>

When the word-meaning-experience is about subtle objects, then savicārā and nirvicārā samāpatti are similarly explained.

We've seen savitarkā and nirvitarkā but savicārā and nirvicārā are even subtler.

In savicārā samādhi there are some traces of experiences. Here, vicāra means anubhūti, experiences.

Nirvicārā means devoid of any experience, just the presence. At that time there is no duality. There is no knower and things to be known. That type of total merger is nirvicārā.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>sūkṣma-vişayatvam ca-alinga-paryavasānam || 45 ||

सूक्ष्मविषयत्वं चालिङ्गपर्यवसानम्॥ ४५॥</span>

And the realm of these subtle objects extends all the way up to the Unmanifest.

When this samādhi goes deeper, it extends till all the deeper impressions are removed and merger with the unmanifest Prakrti happens.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       Prakrti manifests objects around us. It is the primal cause behind the subtle manifestation too. Like this gross world, there is a world of energy which is subtler than this. This is sūkṣma- vişayatvam. In the subtle world of energy too all the five senses are operating. These are called tanmātrā-the subtle aspects of all the five gross elements.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>tā eva sabījaḥ samādhiḥ || 46 ||

ता एव सबीज: समाधिः ॥ ४६॥

All of these (mentioned above) are samādhi with a seed.</span>

You have experienced samādhi but when you come out of it you still have some impressions in you. This is sabīja samādhi. Though you have experienced samādhi, the seed has not been annihilated and still continues to exist. The impressions of lifetimes are still there in seed form.

Most of you have experienced sabīja samādhi during activity, especially in childhood. Have you noticed a child? Its eyes are not flitting here and there. They are very steady. When a child looks at things s/he stares at them and there is a depth in its eyes. This indicates steadiness and stability of the soul. The eyes are the windows to the world and for the world to see your soul; to see its steadiness.

If someone is very ambitious and greedy, their eyes will tell it all. The eyes of a person who is kind and compassionate, reflect very different qualities. Eyes reflect the senses, the behaviour and everything else. Your appearance, your walk, your behaviour, your words and your entire life reflects what you are deep inside. The job of the senses is to give you knowledge of the world. When you polish the senses and make yourself hollow and empty , you become like a crystal. The soul in you reflects the Divinity, the Lord. The senses in you reflect that soul, that Lordship in you. When you look at a flower, you are not just looking at it, you are touching it, feeling the flower and listening to it. All your senses become totally active. The being in you, your senses and the object of your senses, reflect one Divinity like the crystal.

This reflects the purushā in you. This is sabīja samādhi.

You look at a mountain and it reminds you of the Self, the consciousness. You look at a flower and the flower reminds you of consciousness. You look at the sun, moon, water, etc. and these give you an idea of the formless energy, the Self. And at that very moment, you are in samādhi. You may be looking at a sunset and you are in samādhi because the mind and the senses are steady. Steadiness is dignity, strength and dispassion. You can experience this. For a few moments, keep your body and eyes steady and you will see, almost immediately, the mind will also become steady. If you stand still, the mind will become still and the breath will become steady. This is when time stops, death stops and immortality begins. You wake up before time swallows you and before this earth gulps you. Then, you swallow time. This is samādhi. Samādhi is the state where you feel you can stay like that for a million years. It is a state where the mind freezes. Things remain fresh when you put them in a fridge. Samādhi is the refrigerator of your life. It is the secret of youthfulness, the secret of bubbling enthusiasm and the secret of renewal of life. It is steadiness. People wrongly associate samādhi with fasting, skinny bodies, applying ash on the bodies, etc. These are incorrect perceptions.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       When you are in samādhi, every experience of your senses becomes very bright, colourful and complete. When you are happy, you feel expanded. You are not aware of your body. When you are sad, you feel contracted and sorrowful. There seems to be a tightness or reduction in you.

When you feel expanded and your awareness is expanding, you tend to fall asleep. And when you want to have a keenness of awareness, you seem to be more uptight and not relaxed. It takes alertness to thread a needle. A drowsy or drunk person cannot do it. It needs keenness of awareness to do something very delicate.

There are many people who are very skillful. They can carve things on one grain of rice. They have a lot of sharpness of awareness. Yet, when there is keenness of awareness, there is no relaxation; there is no expansion of awareness. And, when the awareness is expanded, there is no keenness of awareness. The combination of both these is sabīja samādhi-when you are totally relaxed, happy and expanded and when, at the same time, you have that sharpness of awareness and intelligence. Your senses become so clear that they can see, hear and perceive better. Ninety-five percent of the population in the world does not hear properly. If you tell people something and ask them to repeat it, you can bet that they will not be able to do it. Or, if you talk to them for fifteen minutes and ask them to repeat what you said, they will never be able to repeat what you said for more than a minute at the most. The rest of what you said has just passed them by. They have not heard it.

This happens with sight too. People are not able to see things as they are. We are insensitive to people's feelings because we do not see or hear properly. Samādhi is being sensitive to other's feelings too. When you become sensitive, the world and nature become sensitive to you. Nature listens to you.

निर्विचारवैशारद्येऽध्यात्मप्रसादः ॥ ४७॥</span>

Of these, when one attains proficiency in nirvicāra samādhi, that brings spiritual fulfillment.

When the mind is free from the thought constraints, then it attains the grace or the blessings of spirituality.



      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       Ādhyātma-prasādah means self-illumination happens to you. Whenever you hear spiritual discourses your mind becomes free. It becomes illumined, quiet and pleasant. This is ādhyātma-prasā dah. The more we practise deep meditation, the less thoughts chatter. What happens then? The energy, the light dawns in you.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>rtambharā tatra prajñā || 48 ||

ऋतंभरा तत्र प्रज्ञा ॥ ४८॥</span>

In such a state, the consciousness is filled with awareness of truth (intuition).

Rtambharā tatra prajñā is that awareness which has the depth of truth, depth of wisdom. It is intuitive knowledge. Satya means truth, rtam means the deeper truth, the subtle truth which is connected to the causal existence. Like the gross and subtle existence, there is a causal existence. That consciousness which is connected with the causal existence, that wisdom, that awareness, is called ritam. This consciousness will be filled with that rtam, so mistakes don't happen through it.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>śruta-anumāna-prajñābhyām anya-viṣayā viśeşa-arthatvāt || 49 || 

श्रुतानुमानप्रज्ञाभ्याम् अन्यविषया विशेषार्थत्वात् ॥४९॥</span>

The awareness (or knowledge) that comes from such a state is special compared to knowledge arising from the senses or the intellect because it is based on a different source (spiritual fulfillment).

This is what happens in our Intuition Process. The children close their eyes and it is stambharā prajñā. From that inner state of consciousness, they predict, they tell the truth, they write things which they have never heard of or seen. A child from India writes Chinese. A child in China writes Samskrta. How is this possible? This is possible by getting into the deeper core of our being. This is rtambharā which is full of intuitive wisdom and it can never be wrong.

tajjah samskāraḥ-anya-samskāra-pratibandhī || 50 ||

तज्जः संस्कारोऽन्यसंस्कारप्रतिबन्धी ॥ ५०॥

The impressions born of such samādhi overrule the impressions generated from other experiences.

This is quite obvious in our life. A greater joy always sublimes the smaller joy. The taste of ecstasy in meditation can take you out of all types of addictions. Ādhyātma-prasādaḥ, the blessings of the spiritual energy can lift us above all the other impressions that we are struggling with or are bound by.

tajjah-samskārah-anya-samskāra-pratibandhī

It can override all other impressions. The impression of that state of consciousness can wipe out all other impressions in the mind which are useless and not necessary for life. Something of the past is erased in your first meditation. You begin to feel that you are a new person. The deeper you go, the more hollow and empty you become. You feel that you are a different person.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       What exactly has happened that makes you feel different? The old samskāras and impressions have been erased from your mind. It has made you new. It renews you again, and again, and again, and again.

Often, when you reflect on events of the past, you feel that you are not the same person you were then. You even feel that it was not you at all; as though you are not at all connected to those events. This is because this samskāra of your consciousness has been erasing those things of your past continuously and has been making you a new person every day. This is the grace of pure knowledge. If someone holds you to something you did in the past, you should laugh at them. This is because you are not the same person now. You should see it as if somebody else had done it. Once Buddha was in an assembly and a gentleman came to him. He was furious. He thought that Buddha was doing something wrong; he was attracting people and making everybody meditate. The people had become very calm and quiet. The gentleman was a restless businessman. He had found that his children were sitting with Buddha and meditating for two hours every day. And he thought that if his children would engage in business, they could make more money and be better off. What would they get by sitting for two hours with somebody with their eyes closed? So he was angry and wanted to teach Buddha a lesson. He walked up to Buddha but as soon as he came near Him all his thoughts disappeared. But he was still shaking with anger and could not speak. No words would come out of his mouth. So he spat on Buddha's face. And Buddha just smiled. However, all the other disciples there became furious but could not react because Buddha was there. So, everybody restrained themselves. The man could not stay any longer because he thought that if he stayed any longer, he would burst out. He went away. He could not sleep the whole night. For the first time in his life, he had met somebody who could smile even when he was spat on. He began shivering. His world had turned topsy-turvy. The next day he went to Buddha and fell at his feet. He asked for forgiveness and said that he was not aware of what he had done. However, Buddha said that he could not forgive him. The disciples were shocked to hear this. Buddha was so compassionate and forgave everybody. How could he not forgive that person! But Buddha explained that the person had done nothing for which forgiveness was required. However, the businessman pointed out that he was the same person who had spat on him the previous day. Then, Buddha said "The person you spat on is not here now. If I ever meet him, I'll tell him to excuse you." Buddha pointed out that the businessman had done no wrong. This is compassion. Compassion is not making a person feel like a culprit and then forgiving him. Your forgiveness should be such that the person, who is being forgiven, does not even know that you are forgiving them. They should not feel guilty of a mistake. That is the right type of forgiveness. If you make someone feel guilty about their mistake, then you have not forgiven them. That guilt itself is the punishment. Knowledge takes you away from guilt and puts you on a pedestal where you do not see the world of the small mind and its useless chattering. It appears insignificant.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>tasya-api nirodhe sarva-nirodhāt-nirbījaḥ samādhiḥ || 51 ||

तस्यापि निरोधे सर्वनिरोधान्निर्बीजः समाधिः ॥ ५१ ॥</span>

When even such impressions (born of samādhi) are eliminated, then, everything having been restrained, seedless samādhi results.

One is gross intuition, the other is subtle intuition, an intuition about something higher. When even this is not encouraged and you move on to another state, that is called nirbīja samādhi- where there is nothing but total union with the existence, with the Divinity.

The Samādhi Pāda is all about the different types of samādhi. The final samādhi is nirvikalpa samādhi or nirbīja samādhi, wherein you are not communicable with the universe at all. That's why usually when any saint leaves the body, people say he has attained samādhi.

Nirvikalpa samādhi totally cuts you off from all of existence. You can experience it for a short time and then you have to come back from there. It cannot be held for too long. But before that there are many stages and these are all good enough.

Nirbīja samādhi can be experienced only through grace and not through effort. It is possible to be in that state of samādhi for a short period of time, but then you have to come back from that state to live in the body. The body cannot sustain nirbīja samādhi for more than three years, after that the body will start decaying. That is the end of life.



      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       There are many different states of awareness and types of samādhi described. The path is long. Every step is complete in itself. It is not that you are aiming for a goal after some time.

The goal is in every moment. Yet the path is long. The goal is where you are. You should not be in a hurry and want samādhi immediately. There should be enthusiasm and along with it patience. Those who are very enthusiastic have no patience.

People who have patience are lethargic. There is either one extreme or the other. You can sleep but you cannot have a quick sleep; a hurried sleep is not possible. You cannot feel that since you are in a hurry, you should sleep quickly, get up and leave.

In the same way, you cannot remember something in a hurry. This hurry delays it all the more. It is the same with meditation.

If you do not have the time, you cannot have a quick meditation. So this path is a middle path, a golden path, wherein you are enthusiastic, at the same time, you are patient. You are patient and, at the same time, you are not lethargic. You are not postponing things. Often, if people have to do something good, something for their personal development, they will feel that if God is willing, they will do it and it will happen. They leave it to God when it comes to their practices and their development. But if they have to build a house or have a relationship they don't leave it to God. They will put in their 100% for that. So, patience and dynamism is the golden rule.

The first chapter is a little technical. If it goes a little over your head, never mind! Read it several times. It is also quite difficult to convey and it is not right to reduce it to a very low level because then it doesn't do justice to this knowledge. It has to go with the experience of it.

This much you can keep in mind-the nine obstacles, and the four subordinates that come with them. How to get over them? Ek tattva abhyāsa. Then Patañjali has given many ways. Yathābhimata dhyānādvā-if you're looking at the moon and looking at the moon is taking you into deep meditation, go ahead with that. If you are listening to a flute, and while listening to it you dissolve, go for it! You don't have to sit and chant at that time . He says that the strong pull of any one of these experiences can also lead you into meditation. These are the ways he is bringing you to what he wants you to know.
