Higher than that (dispassion) is the centeredness that comes from knowing the glory of the Self.

To control the mind from craving and aversion appears to be very difficult. Then, Patañjali says a beautiful thing-if you have had a glimpse of the Self or Puruşa, it becomes very easy for you to get over these cravings. These cravings simply drop off at the mere taste of the Self! When people come here for the first time and do one simple meditation, their craving for many things spontaneously disappears.

Tatparam puruşa-khyāteh-just an interaction, an encounter with the glory of the Being and your interest in the material world starts diminishing.

You do not make an effort to let go of the cravings. The moment you get that inner joy, the moment something clicks within, you get a little glimpse of something, the craving for the sensory objects starts diminishing automatically. It happens spontaneously.

<span className='font-bold'>tatparam puruşa-khyāteh guna-vaitrsnyam</span>

The thirst for the sensory things starts diminishing because the Puruşa, the Self, is much more joyful, much more glorious and is much more charming than anything else.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">

This is the experience of every sādhaka. Anyone who enters the spiritual path gets a little glimpse of it. Just a little glimpse reduces craving, and brings you back to the Self. It creates awareness, the sense of WOW! When you are in a sense of WOW, it is not related to the scenery but to the seer. You can be lost in the scene around you and have a sense of WOW but when you get this WOW about the seer, about the consciousness, it is a very different situation. 

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>vitarka-vicāra-ānanda-asmitā-rūpa-anugamāt samprajñātaḥ || 17 ||

वितर्कविचारानन्दास्मितारूपानुगमात् संप्रज्ञातः ॥ १७॥</span>

(Samādhi) with awareness can happen through logic, thoughts, bliss or a sense of 'I am'.

This state of consciousness, the WOW in you, which creates alertness, which is full of mindfulness, leads to what is called samādhi. What is samādhi? It occurs when there is equanimity in the intellect.

There are four different types of samādhi-vitarka, vicāra, ānanda and asmitā anugamāt samādhi. All these are types of samprajñāt samādhi where awareness still remains.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
      Tarka means logic. Kutarka means wrong logic. When the intention is not right and logic is applied only to find fault; when you know deep within you that something is not right, but you still logically prove that it is right, it is kutarka.

Vitarka is specialised logic. It is not normal logic. 'Who am I?' is vitarka. When you just say, "Who am I?" it is a thought, but this thought that leads you to infinity, to Self-knowledge is vitarka. You ask, "What is this universe?" and don't get the answer, but this question, What is this universe?' is called vitarka. So, this qualified logic that comes up and takes you right back to the Self is one type of samādhi. Certain thoughts that we have, certain suggestions that we give in a guided meditation, take us into deep samādhi.

When there is no thought, but you are doing self-enquiry, it is vitarka samādhi. When I do not give any suggestions but tell you to ask yourself a question, "Who am I?' Then, you sit with your eyes closed and drop down into samādhi. This is vitarka samādhi.

This is another type of samādhi. When I say, "Ok, now sit with your eyes closed and listen to the fan, listen to the birds chirping", you keep listening to these words. These lead to vicāra samādhi.

In vicāra samādhi, your mind is in equanimity, but thoughts are moving; there are thoughts coming and going within.

When I say, "Now your body is all hollow and empty", this is a thought. With this thought you get into an empty space. So, through thought, you get into samādhi.

In vicāra, there are all the experiences of smell, sight, vision, taste or sounds. When you meditate, observing the thoughts that come and go-this is called vicāra samādhi. There are two states of mind that often surface in you. One is a thought which disturbs you and the other is a thought which does not disturb you, but just hovers around in your consciousness and you are aware of it. You are in samādhi, in an equanimous state of mind and at the same time, there are thoughts hovering. It is a part of meditation -thoughts exist, experiences exist.

In vicāra, words, sentences, and thoughts lead you into samādhi. In vitarka, qualified logic or the spirit of enquiry also leads you to samādhi.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Ānanda anugamāt samādhi happens when a bhajan is being played and you feel so blissful that you don't even want to open your eyes. You dissolve in that music; you are in a blissful state. Have you noticed that after you do Sudarśana Kriyā, you are in a different space? The mind is still elevated. The consciousness is still elevated and equanimous but it is in ecstasy. That is ānanda. You feel very happy. Happiness leads you to a space of void or samādhi.

Asmitā anugamāt samādhi is what happens to most of you in deep meditation. Sometime or the other, all of you have experienced that in meditation you just feel that you are present but you don't know where you are. Just the feeling-'I am' exists, nothing else! Without any of the characters or roles you play and the qualifications you have, you simply experience 'I am'. All other characteristics of your personality are shed. It is commonly translated as ego, but it is not the ego. It is 'I am-ness'; being aware of the presence. This is asmitā anugamāt samādhi.

All these four are called samprajñāta, which means that there is consciousness in all this. There is an outflow of awareness throughout.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>virāma-pratyaya-abhyāsa-pūrvaḥ samskāra-śeşah-anyaḥ || 18 ||

विरामप्रत्ययाभ्यासपूर्वः संस्कारशेषोऽन्यः ॥ १८॥</span>

The mind comes to a state of rest by practice done earlier (in this life or in earlier lifetimes) and in this state, only residual
impressions remain. This is another type of samādhi (without awareness).
Different types of samādhi have been described here. There is another type of samādhi where through practice you put an end to all the chattering that is happening in the mind. Virāma means to put a full stop, to put an end to all the content in the mind. There could be some old impressions in the mind that may be lingering on and we are not even mindful of that.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        For some people, this comes through old samskāras, due to some old impressions of past lives, while others have to do a lot of practice in order to be calm and equanimous and to bring up more awareness in them.

Some people start opening up right from their birth while some suddenly open up to a spiritual experience after they are thirty or forty years old. But unfortunately, most of them get misguided. The experience seems so real to them that they think they see visions and they begin to make prophecies about the end of the world, that they may have read somewhere.

This is because they have no knowledge of the root of yoga. They may see a white light coming down and exclaim that something is happening. People get misled by such evangelical experiences. But someone who knows the roots will be aware of all such experiences.

Do you know that when you do tai-chi, qi-gong and yogāsanas mindfully, what you are doing? You are putting an end to all the chattering in the mind. When you listen to the big metallic gong of a Buddhist temple or to the bells in a Hindu temple, at that time, all other thoughts and constraints in the mind are put to rest. Everything stops. Though there may be some old impressions in the consciousness, it definitely leads you into a deeper samādhi.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>bhava-pratyayo videha-prakrti-layānām || 19 ||

भवप्रत्ययो विदेहप्रकृतिलयानाम् ॥ १९॥</span>

For those who are immersed in nature or (are) without a body, the world is the content of the mind.

Bhava-pratyayo-the whole world becomes the content (bhava means the world, pratyayo is the content) of consciousness. See, if you are thinking only about yourself, your thinking is limited. Your limited worry is different from the worry about the entire planet. The entire universe is the content, for whom? For the videha and the prakrtilayānām. Videha are the angels and gods
 who are beyond physical appearance. Prakrtilayānām are those who have dissolved into nature. For both of them, bhava pratyayo -the whole universe is the content. That is samādhi here. For the angels, gods, and spirits samādhi is the entire universe.

bhava-pratyayo videha-prakrti-layānām

Similarly, for those who are deeply immersed in prakrti, being in the universe itself is samādhi.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Samādhi does not belong to just a particular level of existence. It surpasses that level too. It goes into other worlds also. Those who do not have a body also can be affected by meditation. When you meditate, you are not just bringing harmony within yourself but you are influencing the subtle layers of creation and the subtle bodies at all the different levels of existence in the creation. So, your meditation influences those people who lived hundreds of years ago, their consciousness and their minds. It influences the minds and consciousness of people who would be living in the future too. Though life is there in every moment, it is also infinite. Your life has been here for centuries and will continue to be here for a few more centuries.

Prakrti layā means those who are completely submerged in nature. Suppose someone is totally dedicated to saving the ocean . Day and night, they think only about the cleanliness of the ocean. Someone who is thinking about the Earth, only thinks about the betterment of the Earth and nothing else. Immersed in these thoughts, they get into a state of awareness. They don't have any other wish, any other desire in life. They are totally focused on their work. They don't even know whether they are eating or sleeping. They don't have time for family and friends either. They are so totally immersed in work. They are so far away from the material existence that they are not even aware of it. They also attain the state of equanimity. This is prakrti layā. This also leads you to a state of samādhi.

Prakrti layā is a big practice. People sit in solitude for years till all thoughts disappear. And that is when they attain emptiness.

When you look at a mountain, sometimes you forget yourself. You have no awareness of your thoughts, mind or body, no awareness at all. You are merging with nature at that moment. You are looking at the sunset. You are there along with the sun and then in a while you are not aware of yourself. You are just aware of the sun. This is prakrti layā samādhi.

You can try doing this as an experiment. When you are very worried or tense, just sit by a flowing river or stream and keep looking at the water. Within a few moments, you feel as though there is a magnetic pull; your mind is being pulled in the direction of the current.

       You can try doing this as an experiment. When you are very worried or tense, just sit by a flowing river or stream and keep looking at the water. Within a few moments, you feel as though there is a magnetic pull; your mind is being pulled in the direction of the current.

Then, sit on the other bank and do the same thing and you'll see that your mind is being pulled in the other direction. That is why many people who want to jump into a river and commit suicide, cannot do so once they look at the flowing water. Something happens within them at the sight of the flowing water. There is a shift, and they can no longer commit suicide. This happens because, by looking at the water, there is a change in the vibrations of their mind, the prāņa in the system. In a short while, all their anguish, delusions and whatever was tormenting them flows away. They become fresh.

People love the ocean because there is more prāņa there, more ozone. When you go on looking at the waves one after another, it washes something away. This is prakrti-layā meditation, where you dissolve yourself in nature.

Bhava-pratyayo-for them, the content is this whole universe. It is the same with the gods and goddesses who take care of the world. Taking care of the world itself is their samādhi.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>śraddhā-vīrya-smrti-samādhi-prajñā-pūrvaka itareşām || 20 ||

श्रद्धावीर्यस्मृतिसमाधिप्रज्ञापूर्वक इतरेषाम् ॥ २०॥</span>

Other ways to obtain samādhi are through faith, valour, memory of your origin and awareness of a previous experience of samādhi

Now, we will look at the other types of samādhi.

Śraddhā-faith-creates good qualities in your consciousness. It is made stable, steady and solid. Doubt in the consciousness makes you very vulnerable, fearful and uncertain. It scatters and destroys you. It pulls you apart. Doubt disseminates your energy, while faith consolidates it. The feeling when you have faith is a form of consolidation, a strength. It makes you strong. Faith brings totality in you. It pulls together all the loose ends of your consciousness. It integrates your whole personality.

That is why Jesus also said that faith is your strength. They are synonymous-faith and strength. When you have faith, you are strong and bold. When you are weak and feeble, you have doubts. Doubt and uncertainty are signs of weakness.

Meditation takes place just out of faith. When there is unshakeable faith, that also leads a person into a state of void and he attains samādhi.

Vīrya is valour, vigour or force, courage and vitality. It is total courage and valour with which a country is defended by its army. We fight for our country when it is in danger. All the energy in the system comes together during that time. This is how valour rises in people.

In that moment of valour and extreme sense of patriotism, there is tremendous joy. That is why this world has wars again and again. If people completely condemn wars and if nobody likes them, then they cannot take place. Though the after-effects of war are very unpleasant, its course is very thrilling. People enjoy thrilling movies for the same reason.



      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
      Every cell in our body becomes united and the whole consciousness becomes one. The defence system gets awakened in you. This is strength. When the defence system peaks, it is very joyful because there is equanimity too. There is a sense of patriotism, devotion and gratitude. That sense of patriotism, valour or vigour also takes you into a state of meditation.

When someone goes to climb Mount Everest and has the feeling of, 'I want to achieve it', that is valour. When someone travels around the world in a sailboat and has a sense of 'I will do it', that is valour.

When a soldier at the border puts his life at risk, that is vīrya, valour. The peak of valour leads you to samādhi. The peak of faith , śraddhā, leads you to samādhi.

Smrti is the remembrance of your origin. Come on, wake up! You are not here for the first time! You have been here a million times . When you 'wake up', you become aware of your true Self; of who you are. You are not what you think you are today. You are not the nationality. Today you are an American or Spaniard or Russian or Indian but 100 years ago, 200 years ago, 500 years ago you were different. This is not the only identity you have. When you remember your true identity, your true nature, even then you reach a state of samādhi. Smrti, the memory of your origin, your past, can lead you to samādhi.

Smrti also means the memory of a very peaceful and beautiful state of mind. The very memory of the experience will make you relive that experience. The memory of samādhi reproduces the memory of one's Being, of the Self, freedom, devotion, surrender, love, and joy. This takes you back to the Self.

Often, we do not remember nice things. What we remember are negative things. We do not remember compliments but we remember insults. Yoga is turning the wheel around to remember those wonderful moments you have had. Sit and be with them, and with those very memories your entire being gets back to that wonderful state.

Śraddhā-vīrya-smrti-samādhi-here again, samādhi is a balance of the mind. If you have total balance of mind, it leads you to this deeper samādhi.



      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       <span className='font-semibold'>Prajñā </span> is mindfulness, total alertness. Awareness of mind, presence of mind also leads you to samādhi. Samādhi-prajñā means awareness of the samādhi that you have experienced. Even if you experience deep serenity inside you once, the memory of that wonderful experience can rekindle that experience in your life again and again and again.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>tīvra-samvegānām āsannah || 21 ||

तीव्रसंवेगानाम् आसन्नः ॥ २१॥</span>

Through intensity of practice, it (samādhi) is expedited.

Here it is very important to note what Maharşi Patañjali is saying. You need to have passion, an intense longing.

<span font-semibold>tīvra-samvegānām-āsannah</span>

Earlier the Maharşi said, "You have to shun passion. You have to slow down," but here he says, "You should have 100% passion for it, only then can it happen." With passion, success comes very quickly. If there is a one-point intent and an intense desire to do it, then it will happen.

On the other hand, he says, "Rein in your desires." You have to now balance these two things. They appear to be opposites but they are not. They complement each other. You cool down your craving for the outer world but if you put 100% attention and go deep within, then success is for sure.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>mrdu-madhya-adhimātratvāt tatah-api viśeşah || 2

मृदुमध्याधिमात्रत्वात् ततोऽपि विशेषः ॥ २२॥</span>

Even among that (intensity of practice) it is qualified as mild, medium or intense.

People put varied efforts in their practice. Some just do it mildly, others do it a little more intently, and the third type of people do it with the utmost intensity.

Some people just do sādhanā thinking that they have to do a little while looking at the phone, doing this and that. They are just doing sādhanā for the sake of doing it.There are others, who are a little more serious. They think, "Yes, I must do it, I must practise."

Then, there are those who are dedicated to it. So, there are three different levels of people and the result of their effort is according to their intent. Each one will get something. The effects will also be at different levels-supreme, medium and mild.
