ईश्वरप्रणिधानाद् वा ॥ २३॥

Or (one can achieve samādhi) by surrendering to the Divine.
</span>
Surrendering to the Lord, you can achieve the full blossomed state of consciousness.

Now, what is the Lord? Who is the Lord? Where is He? It is easy to say surrender to God but what is God? Where is God? Nobody has ever seen God. What is it that rules this world?

You will find that it is love that rules the world. Just like the Sun is the centre of the solar system and rules all the planets, love is the core of your life. Love is beyond your changing body, changing thoughts, and changing feelings. It is the very centre, core of your existence, which is very subtle and delicate. That consciousness, the core of existence, is responsible for this whole creation. There lies the lordship.

A bird feeds its young ones because of love. A flower blossoms because of love. Ducks hatch eggs because of love. Cows take care of their calves because of love. Kittens are taken care of by their mothers because of love. Have you seen how monkeys care for their young ones? Love is in-built in creation. This is how the creation functions. That is why Jesus said, "Love is God. God is love." They are synonymous.

Here Maharși Patañjali says that dedication or devotion to the Divine can also lead you into samādhi. Now, who is the Divine? What are the characteristics of the Divine?

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>kleśa-karma-vipāka-āśayaiḥ-aparāmrşţaḥ puruṣaviśeşa īśvaraḥ || 24 ||

क्लेशकर्मविपाकाशयैरपरामृष्टः पुरुषविशेष ईश्वरः ॥ २४॥</span>

Divinity is that special consciousness which is untouched by misery, fruits of actions and desires (latent and manifest). 
What is the sign of Divinity? The divine energy is untouched by kleśa-misery, untouched by any impact of karma and by vipāka -the fruit of action. That consciousness, that special being is Iśvara. Patañjali says that Iśvara is also a being. Being is that which IS; the consciousness which IS. That special consciousness which is free from misery, karma, the fruit of karma, āśayaih-its impressions, implications-that puruşa-viśeşa is Iśvara.

      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       There are <span className='font-semi-bold'>four</span> types of karmas.

The karma which gives merits. You may do something good for somebody and they feel good about it and may thank you for it. They thank you from their heart, and that brings you good karma.

There is another type of karma which brings you demerits. You might do something bad to somebody and they suffer because of it. That brings you karma of demerit.

There are certain karmas which are a combination of merit and demerit. This is the third type of karma.

Karmas devoid of both merit and demerit. These actions have no merit or demerit. They are just actions. For example, you go for a walk in the evening or you vacuum the hall. But if you are doing it for somebody then that is an action of merit. If you are helping someone in the kitchen, cutting vegetables and cooking food for everybody, then it is an action of merit.

Actions which give merit, which give demerit, which give mixed results and which have no results at all are the four types of karmas. At the very core of your existence, the Being is free from all these karmas; it has no karma. Whatever action that comes forth from the Lord is not attached to any karma.

Vipāka is the fruit or consequence of the action. The fruit ( enjoyment or suffering) of an action does not touch that core of your being and existence, which is the Lord of the creation. That consciousness is free from this.

Āśayaiḥ means latent desires or impressions, seeds, opinions, etc. So when a being is free from kleśa, (misery), karma, vipāka (the fruit of action), and āśayaih (the impressions of actions), then that being or consciousness is Iśvara or Lord. And the Lord is not somewhere in the sky but in your heart. It is in every being's heart. Your actions and the events taking place around you do not touch the central point of your life. That central core remains a virgin. Jesus was born to a virgin. This means that Jesus, the Lord was born to an area deep within you which is untouched by any events or happenings in life.

Puruşa-viśeşa-that special being is the Lord. All worship is done by the mind for its Being. It is like the circumference collapsing into the centre. What happens when a boundary collapses into the centre? The area, which had been enclosed by the circumference, becomes infinite, limitless. When our little chattering mind prays, it does so to the Infinite Being that you are . Your external mind worships the core of your being. That is prayer-when you ask your Lord to help you.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Krşņa meant this when He said that one may pray to whoever he wants but the prayer goes to only Him because He is the core of existence. You may worship one form of God. Another may worship a different form. A third person may worship yet another form. Essentially, worship is just an act of dissolution-a sugar doll or candy getting dissolved in water. It does not matter at which point it gets into the water. It is going to dissolve and merge. Similarly, worship dissolves the mind of the worshipper. It is the act of dissolving the mind into its being; the Being which is free from kleśa karma vipāka-āśayaih. This takes place almost instantaneously. That is why there is no difference between God, Guru and the Self.

In the Dakşiņāmūrti stotram it is said,

īśvaro guruh-ātmeti murti bheda vibhāgine

vyoma-vad vyāpta-dehāya dakšiņā-mūrtaye namah

<span className='font-semibold'>ईश्वरो गुरुरात्मेति मूर्तिभेदविभागिने। व्योमवद् व्याप्तदेहाय दक्षिणामूर्तये नमः ॥</span>

It is just a matter of using different words which are synonymous. The Master is the core of your being. And so is the Divine who rules this entire creation.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>tatra niratiśayam sarvajñatva-bījam || 25 ||

तत्र निरतिशयं सर्वज्ञत्वबीजम् ॥ २५॥</span>

The seed of all knowingness abides in that (Lordship). In that state of consciousness the seed of all-knowing is present in a very subtle manner. It means that you have the key to the entire library. The key to the library is present in this consciousness.

If Krşņa knew everything, why did He try to pacify all concerned, and try to stop the war thrice? He knew that a war was going to take place but He never told Arjuna this, and also that he was going to win. Instead, He told Arjuna that if he won the war, he would rule the world. And if he lost it, he would go to heaven. It did not seem as if He knew everything. The way He gave answers and instructions, it did not indicate that He knew the future. So if Krşņa was the Lord and knew it all, why did He not reveal it? Many such questions are still being asked.

      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Tatra niratiśayam sarvajñatva-bījam-this seed of all-knowing- ness is present. For example, if you have a dictionary, you can check the meaning of any word you want. You don't need to memorize every word there. Nor do you need to know all the words in the dictionary all the time.

You may open yourself up to this highest form of your consciousness. At that moment, you have all the knowledge-you can know and feel all the beings in the world. You can know how many beings there are and what they are doing-some may be waking up, some going to bed, some taking a bath, some in their cars, some fighting, some eating and some doing other activities. This is just about people.

But take into account the entire creation. There are so many connected activities-so many chickens are hatching, so many are being slaughtered, so many buffaloes are wandering around and so many cows are chewing cud, so many monkeys are jumping from tree to tree. There are so many ants, cockroaches, flies, mosquitoes, amoeba, etc. There are billions of viruses and bacteria. Many are dying and many are being born. There is enormous activity going on at any moment. But amidst this enormous activity, you just wonder what a particular person is doing. This takes so much effort and is not worth it.

Sometimes, people ask me how I know their most well-kept secrets, those which they have not told anybody. I tell them that I do not know how but I know. And then sometimes, I search for my own keys which I have misplaced! This is even more confusing to people. They wonder how I know what they have never told anybody but how do I not know where I have kept my keys! I tell them that it is possible-just like they know they have hair on their head but do not know how many.

Knowledge and ignorance co-exist. That is why it is said tatra niratiśayam sarvajñatva-bījam. This seed of all-knowing-ness is present in the Lordship, in that state of consciousness.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>pūrveşām api guruḥ kālena-anavacchedāt || 26 ||

पूर्वेषाम् अपि गुरुः कालेनानवच्छेदात् ॥ २६॥</span>

That (Lordship) is the Guru for those who came before too, as it is unobstructed by time.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       
This consciousness is the Guru, even for the Gurus of the past, because time has no role to play in this consciousness. This consciousness is beyond time. It continues, uninterrupted by time . That consciousness is the Guru tattva. The Master is the core of your being. And so is the Divine who rules this entire creation.

There is something similar in the Bible. Jesus said that He had taught people who came even before Abraham. The same thing is touched upon by Krsna when he told Arjuna that He had taught Ikşvāku and Manu. And Arjuna wondered how Krsna could have taught them. They had been born long ago and Krşņa was his contemporary. Arjuna exclaimed that he was terribly confused already and that he could not understand how Krşņa was a Guru to people who lived thousands of years before Him. How could it be possible?

Then Krşņa said that Arjuna did not really know Him. That He had come so many times to this world and Arjuna too had come many times. He had forgotten but Krşņa knew it all. He had taught at that time and he was teaching right then too and would continue to teach in the future.

The Guru principle is the same because there is no break in time. It continues. Jesus is continuing throughout. It is not that he stopped somewhere. People may think that He will come in the future.

Purveshām-api guruhu-that Being was, is and will be the Master at all times because there is no break in time.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>tasya vācakaḥ pranavah || 27 ||

तस्य वाचकः प्रणवः ॥ २७॥</span>

That is addressed as 'Om'.

This Om is your true name. All other names are just for one lifetime. Your real name, for all lifetimes, is Om. When you realise that your consciousness is eternal, it has been here for millennia, that awareness of your consciousness is the puruşa-viśeșa. It is the special puruşa, the special aspect of your being and it is. addressed by Om. That is Iśvara.

Om is the nearest sound that It could be addressed by because when Om is chanted, the prāņa and the consciousness is complete. Om is made of 'aa', 'oo' and 'mm'. When you say 'aa', the prāņa is in the lower part of the body, with 'oo' it is in the middle and with 'mm' it is in the top part of the body. When you say 'Om', the prāņa is total; it is complete.



      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       Om is the one sound which is accepted by all the religions in the world. Christians say 'Amen' and Muslims 'Ameen', sounds very close to Om.

So, jeevesvara, jeeva-the being (the individual life) and Iśvara ( the Divinity) are not different. They are one and the same. When you realise a part of your deeper consciousness is uninterrupted by time, and when that comes to play in you that is the Guru tattva, the Guru. So that consciousness has been the Guru from the very beginning.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>tad-japah tad-artha-bhāvanam || 28 ||

तज्जपः तदर्थभावनम् ॥ २८॥</span>

Its repetition and feeling its meaning.
The repetition of Om reveals its meaning. When you sit and repeat Om, the meaning of Om, which is eternal or eternity, which is infinity, simply starts manifesting in you.

For example, if you say mango, the word itself makes your mouth water. Immediately there is a reaction and there is a feeling. Saying 'Christmas' immediately generates a feeling of celebration, of giving and receiving gifts.

Taj-japah tad-artha-bhāvanam-when you say Om, you remember that totality of your being, that Being which is at the very core of this existence, that life which is free from misery and which is all unconditional love. The sound Om reminds you of the Lord of creation.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>tataḥ pratyak-cetanā-adhigamah-api- antaraya-abhāvaḥ-ca || 29 ||
ततः प्रत्यक्चेतनाधिगमोऽप्यन्तरायाभावश्च ॥ २९॥</span>

From that is gained the knowledge of consciousness and the destruction of obstacles.
From just contemplating Om and chanting it, the witness consciousness starts taking shape inside you. You start separating from the scenery. You will get pratyak-cetanā. The differentiated consciousness in you starts blossoming. You see thoughts coming and moving. You then know that you are not the thought, you are not the feeling, you are not the body. This feeling is generated spontaneously. Doesn't it happen to you when you sit in meditation? You see that your body is different from you, right?

"I am not the body, I am not the thoughts, I am not the emotions, I am not all this." This is pratyak-cetanā. That state of consciousness springs up, and then all the obstacles go away..

Antarāya-abhavaś-ca-obstacles don't rise there at all. Otherwise, there are many obstacles that might arise during the practice, but with the chanting of Om and surrendering to the divine principle, those obstacles simply vanish.
