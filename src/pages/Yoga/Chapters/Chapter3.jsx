They (the modulations) can be restrained by practice and dispassion.

Can you imagine, thousands of years ago, the Maharși went to the finest details of defining what sleep is, what memory is, what proof in the mind is? Isn't this mind-boggling? How the seer or the subject has to withdraw from the scenery or the object, back to their consciousness and be established in the source-that is the union of oneself with oneself; that is yoga. It is an amazing way of describing the most indescribable truth in the universe, the most indescribable phenomenon, called consciousness.

How can consciousness be established in the seer? He said there are two ways. One is abhyāsa-practice and the other, vairāgya- dispassion. When you are passionate, your mind is all over the place. You have lost yourself and you are in that object or person or event or situation that you are passionate about. You lose yourself and you are so totally there. Dispassion alone can bring you back to the seer.

The effort to be established there (in the seer) is practice.

        Now,<span className='font-bold text-lg'>what is dispassion and what is practice? Maharşi Patañjali has described them in an amazing manner!

That which you do to 'be' here and now, in this moment, is abhyāsa. An effort is needed for you to relieve yourself from the five modulations and just be here-Now! Now! Now!-to bring the mind to the present and not dwell on past memories. This effort is called abhyāsa.
You can start by being determined that you are not going to dwell on any logic. You are not going to be interested in any proof. Then, you are free from pramāņa. If the mind is asking for proof, just know it, observe it and relax.

You are not interested in any wrong knowledge or right knowledge either. Often when the mind holds on to wrong knowledge, it thinks it is right. So, the mind is not even interested in knowing anything, whether right or wrong. Retrieve the mind from knowing and from knowledge. There is no anxiety to see, smell, touch, feel or understand anything. Let things be the way they are. Do not care. Do not pass judgements of right or wrong. Free yourself from viparyaya.

Then vikalpa. Check if the mind is dwelling on some imagination or fantasy. By just knowing that it is imagining or fantasizing, it drops off, thereby freeing you. The minute you realise that you are dreaming-the dream vanishes. That moment is so new, so fresh and so total!

      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       Abhyāsa is just recognizing the moment when you are free, fresh, full and totally in the present moment. Here your mind might try to go into the past. You know that the mind is getting into the five vrttis, but without any aversion or craving. This is coming back to the centre, to the seer.
Coming back to this moment, again and again and again; the effort to stay focused on the seer, is abhyāsa.

You come back to the seer but you can lose it again because you are drawn by the scenery. Again, when the scenery is not so interesting you come back to the seer. You become more conscious of yourself when you are done with the scenery, with the sense objects. When you are done with the scenery outside, you go within. These moments happen rarely in everyone's life. Now and then, here and there, these experiences come to you. But if you make an effort to stay conscious, to keep mindfulness, that is called practice, abhyāsa.

tatra sthitau yatno'bhyāsah

To stay there is practice, and it needs effort.

'Never mind' is a very interesting phrase. The mind can never go where you are; a wave can never go to the depth of the ocean. By the time the wave goes to the depth, it ceases to be a wave. So the mind can never come to you. The mind can never be you. That is why 'never mind'! You are never the mind; it is superficial.

The moment the mind starts coming towards you, it is not the mind anymore. That is why it is 'never mind'. 'You' are accepted there, never the mind; your mind can never go there.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        The mind keeps on asking questions, "Why, Why, Why?" This is an experience all of you have had. You feel that something that is bothering you is your mind stuff! At that moment, alertness and awareness dawn. And then there is relief in the mind. The more you feel that your questions are just mind stuff, the more aware you are. Then the questions just vanish. This is abhyāsa, this is practice.

स तु दीर्घकाल नैरन्तर्य सत्कारासेवितो दृढभूमिः ॥ १४॥</span>

Practice gets established when it is done uninterruptedly for a long time, without a break and with honour and respect.

Now, you have to practice for a long period of time, with dedication and respect. You should honour your practice. Don't just do your practice because you need to. No! When you honour the practice, respect it, give it more importance, it becomes well- founded in you.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       Nairantarya-it is very important that the practice be done uninterruptedly. If you receive a mantra, chant it for two days and then become irregular, it is not going to work. There should be an uninterrupted practice of chanting. This is very important. Even if it is for a few minutes, it must be uninterrupted. You must do it every day. Only then will it become well established in you.

The effort to be still and steady comes with practice. At some point in time, you may realise that it is 'the moment' and then it vanishes. You feel that the moment came and you lost it. You say, 'Now', and then the 'Now' is lost. It may not be right to say you have lost it but in some sense, you feel you are not in the 'Now'. This effort is not just linear. This effort to be steadily established in the 'Now' is very deep and vast. The 'Now, the present moment, is not just a point; not just a dot. It is infinite. It is 'Now' in all dimensions and from all sides. Practice gives stability at that moment-that is the purpose of practice. And how can that be arranged? How can that be achieved?

Sa tu dīrghakāla-it takes a long time.

Nairantarya-without a gap.

Satkārāsevito-practising it with honour and respect.

Drdhabhūmih-one becomes firmly grounded.

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
      Anything of value in life takes some time to culture. To master an art-cooking, playing the guitar, sitar, or flute-takes time. Learning to play an instrument takes quite a while and to master it takes longer, but the mind takes even longer for its growth. Constant practice without a gap is essential. If there is no consistency, nothing is gained. Lack of consistency prevents you from learning any art.

Satkārāsevito-doing it with honour and respect. Sometimes, you grumble when you do something. That is not abhyāsa. Abhyāsa is something done with gratitude, gratefulness, honour and with respect. This is something we often lack in our lives. We should do everything in life with honour and respect.

Even if you do something with honour and respect, it lasts for a very short period. And if you have to do something over a period of time, you tend to lose that honour and respect. If you have to arrange a stage and if you are doing it for the first time, you do it with all honour and respect. You put in much attention, love, your heart, and awareness into doing it. But if you have to do it every day for the next six months, you just do it without the spirit with which you did it on the first day.

As time goes on, you lose that alertness, attention, attentiveness, and honour. You feel wonderful when you sit for meditation the first day because you are doing it with honour. But after some sessions you feel bored. You just sit and close your eyes and it doesn't have the same effect.

If any day, your meditation or Sudarśana Kriyā is a little low, it is because you have lost respect for it, not that you disrespect it, but the attentiveness and alertness towards it has reduced.

When you come to do a course, your meditation is deeper because you are receiving it with honour. You are honouring that knowledge. You are honouring yourself.



      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
      <span className='font-semibold'>What is honour? Have you ever thought about it? Honour is total attentiveness to the present moment, with a tinge of gratefulness</span>

Respect and honour every moment of your life. Then that becomes a practice. You respect your own body. That is practice, abhyāsa.

What are āsanas? Āsanas are respecting your own body consciously, every moment.

Respecting and honouring your breath is prāņāyāma.

So, be determined to honour. Consider all the other events to be trivial. Just honour the moment. However the moment may be, it is very precious. Honour the word the Master has given you.

It is very precious. Honouring the Master is honouring the Master' s word. If you do not have honour or respect for the Master, your meditation will not work. This is because that honour and the respect awakens the consciousness and raises awareness in you. It helps you to focus on the moment totally. If you do not honour the Master, the Master will not lose anything. Your own mind will be unable to be in the moment totally and to dive deep into the source.

Is this enough? Is just abhyāsa, practice, enough?

No, it is not. There are two oxen that are needed to pull this cart. One is abhyāsa and the other is vairāgya.
