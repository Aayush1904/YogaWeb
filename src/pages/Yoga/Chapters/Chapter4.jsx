Dispassion is having a say over the thirst that arises from sense objects, either experienced by oneself or heard of from others.

So the Maharși says that you need to do two things-one is to practise and the other is to cultivate dispassion. To stay there in that presence, you need to practise uninterruptedly, over a long period of time, with devotion, with respect and honour for the practice. Then it becomes a very solid ground for you. It makes you stronger. Now,<span className='font-semibold'> what is vairāgya, dispassion?</span>

vaśīkāra-sañjñā vairāgyam</span>

The mind gallops towards the world of five senses. Whether you are quiet, have your eyes closed or open, or doing anything, where does your mind go? It goes towards the five senses.

You have experienced many things in the world through the five senses. You can see, hear, taste, smell, and touch. If whatever you experience through these five senses creates craving or aversion inside you, then you lack dispassion. It takes your attention away and rattles the mind. What rattles the mind? Craving! When you are craving for something, you are stuck with the object, the scenery, and are not with the seer. Craving for any of these experiences can prevent you from being in the present moment.

Vairāgya is controlling the craving for objects that you have experienced or heard of. When you have relished nice food, you crave it. You crave sex; you crave appreciation, recognition, praise , and flattery.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
Then there is another type of craving for that which you have not experienced but have only heard of. Jihadis are told that by killing certain people they will go to heaven. They have no idea,but they have only heard from some people that when you do such-and-such things, you will get first-class treatment, super luxurious comfort in heaven. So, people get swayed by what they hear.

All crime and conflicts happen in society because of such cravings. What is conflict? It is self-righteousness and selfishness to possess ; a self-centered attitude. In English, we call it self-centered. It is not the same Self that Maharși Patañjali is talking about. It is the complete opposite. He talks about being non-self-centric.

Vairāgya is to have a say over these cravings; reining in these tendencies in you, bringing the mind back to its source. Then you will feel that however beautiful a scene is, however great the food , however melodious the music, you are not interested. Vairāgya may be present for even a few moments. This is another basic requirement for meditation. Dispassion has to arise in your mind whenever you want to meditate. Without dispassion, your meditation is no good. It cannot provide you the rest that you are longing for.

Your mind is tired and burnt out because it is galloping towards one desire after another. Just look back and check all the desires that you have fulfilled. Have they given you rest? Have they given you any fulfillment? They have not. They have just created some more desires in you. They have just given you a greater hope that you can achieve more; you can have more. And that has sent you on another pointless trip. You are on a merry-go-round. It is not even merry but just goes round and round. A merry-go-round has dummy horses that you sit on. The horses do not go anywhere. They just go round and round in the same place but give you the illusion that you have traveled miles and miles.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       
Life has been such a journey where you are galloping and galloping, reaching nowhere. This is what desires do to you. The mind which is obsessed with desires cannot meditate.

On the other extreme, some people feel that the mind should not have any desires and this becomes another desire. They are on this trip to destroy their desires. They keep beating around the bush and achieve nothing.

The craving for any of the sense objects, celestial or heavenly places, which the mind gallops towards is an obstruction. Any expectation in meditation is an obstruction. You may have heard that someone saw a light in their meditation or saw somebody coming from heaven and taking them by the hand. So, you sit with your eyes closed and wait for an angel to come or for a light to shine on you and then to burst into a million stars. All these ideas and thoughts become an obstruction. Your desire for pleasure or happiness will make you unhappy.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       If you examine yourself whenever you are miserable or unhappy, you will find that the misery is due to your desire to be happy. Craving happiness brings misery. When you do not crave for happiness, you are liberated and when you do not even care for liberation, you attain love. This is parama vairāgya. But that is the second step; the first step is when you do not crave for happiness. Then you are free. You are liberated.

Happiness is a mere idea in your mind. You think if you have a particular thing, you will be happy. If you have whatever you want are you sure you will be happy? Then, you will think it was not the way that you had thought it would be.

What great happiness do you want? How long can you have it? You are going to leave this life at some time or the other. This is certain. It is all going to end. Before this Earth eats you up, become free.

You need to shatter all your dreams and fantasies. Offer them to the fire, burn them down. Free yourself from the feverishness that is gripping your mind. Free yourself from the craving for happiness. Every object of pleasure that you have experienced will become like styrofoam-absolutely tasteless!

All these objects, such as food and sex, that titillate the senses have their limitations. But your mind is not ready to accept these limitations. It wants unlimited joy and pleasure which the five senses cannot give you. Vairāgya is putting a stop to the craving for happiness.

This does not mean that you have to be miserable. It does not mean you should not enjoy life. But if you can retrieve your mind from the craving for joy, you can meditate. Then you can have all the five modulations, and still yoga happens.

Often, people who think they have dispassion keep blaming the world and the objects of senses. They are afraid of the objects of the senses and try to run away from them.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Vairāgya is skillfully reaching the Self by honouring all the objects of the senses and not blaming them.
Question: Dear Gurudev, is it possible to get stuck in achieving a mood of dispassion, turning one's attention to the separation between the Self and the thoughts, emotions and sensory data, and is it possible to see more clearly who one is? If a habit of separating oneself from everything is developed in an artificial way, will one not lose spontaneity, attunement with nature and be unable to fully engage in life by giving it their hundred percent . How do you walk this tightrope, and how do you know if you are too far on one side or the other?

Gurudev: Dispassion does not divide you. In fact, it connects you. It connects you to the present moment so totally that you can be one hundred percent in anything that you are doing. When you are not dispassionate, then what happens? You are linked to the past or the future. You are not one hundred percent connected to the present and are more divided. So when your mind is hoping for something in the future or regretting the past, it is not hundred percent with the moment; it is divided already.

When you are fully centred while doing anything, then you are hundred percent with every moment. You may be eating and you are eating one hundred percent. You enjoy every bit of it. You can feel every sip of the soup you are having. Every bite of the food tastes great. Every sight is fresh and new. Your love is like the first love every moment. When you look at anybody or anything, it is charming to the very core; as if you are seeing it for the first time.

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       Dispassion does not take away the joy from you. Dispassion gives the joy which nothing else can give. There is a verse by Ādi Ś ankarācārya that says, "Kasya sukham na karoti virāgah!" What pleasure can dispassion not give you! It gives you all possible pleasures because you are so totally in the moment. It puts you a hundred percent in the moment. Every moment is a peak experience.

The so-called dispassion in the world seems so dry. People who think they are dispassionate are melancholy; they are sad. They run away from the world and call it dispassion. Then they say that they have renounced the world. This is no renunciation or dispassion. People who escape because of failure, misery, sorrow, or apathy feel that they have dispassion. Dispassion is something far more precious, more refined, and more valuable in life. If you are dispassionate, you are always centered-full of joy and contentment. Anybody would like to be like that.

Before Alexander the Great came to India, people in his country had told him that if he found some sanyāsīs, he should bring them back with him; they were very precious and were to be found only in India. When he was in India he ordered that some sanyāsīs come to him but nobody came. He then sent a message threatening to chop off their heads. Even then, nobody came! Next, he said that he was going to take away their books-the four vedas and other scriptures too. The pundits agreed and said that they would give him all their books the next day. Overnight, the pundits made their children memorize all the manuscripts, and then they gave them to Alexander. They told him that they did not need them anymore.




      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Alexander got the manuscripts but he wanted a sanyāsi, and a sanyāsi would not come. Finally, he went to one and threatened him saying that he would chop off his head if he did not go with him. The sanyāsi replied that Alexander could do so if he wanted to. The mighty emperor could not even look into the sanyāsi's eyes. He could not stand the power of dispassion that he saw there. Here was a person who, for the first time, did not care for an emperor.

Once, some people presented him with golden bread on a plate. But he said that he was hungry and wanted some real bread. They replied that he was an emperor, how could he eat mere wheat bread? They had prepared golden bread for him. Alexander said that he was starving and wanted real bread. Hearing this, they got some real bread for him. They asked him if such bread was not available in his country. They wanted to know that if he ate the same bread which was eaten in India, then why had he conquered so many places. Was it to get bread?

This question shook Alexander. The power of the truth hit him. What was the point in conquering country after country when all that he needed was to live peacefully and happily? Devoid of happiness and peace, without care and concern for his people, putting his stamp on all the villages and towns he was conquering, had no meaning.

So, Alexander said that when he dies his hands should be kept open. He wanted people to know that though he had conquered so many countries, Alexander the Great left this world empty- handed!

Dispassion is the strength in you. Even if the Lord of Wealth comes, you do not need to take anything from him. That is the strength of dispassion. It is not arrogance. It is centred-ness. If you are centred and calm, then you can understand that everyone has come to this world to give something, not to take anything from here. A great shift takes place.
