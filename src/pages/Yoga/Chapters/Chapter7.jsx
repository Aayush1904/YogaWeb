Illness in the body, mental dullness, doubt, carelessness, laziness, obsessions, hallucination, no experience in practice and instability are the obstacles or distractions (in the practise of yoga).

Vyādhi-bodily illness. When you are sick, you do not want to do anything, any sādhanā, any practice. Illness is a big obstacle. If you are watching television, nothing happens, but if you sit for meditation, your body becomes restless and there are pains here and there. Many times it so happens that when people meditate or do some advanced sādhanā, they get affected by fever, cold, cough, etc. All these are obstacles for deeper meditation and yogic practices.

Styāna-inertia in the mind, mental illnesses, an inability to comprehend, to listen, to understand, to follow and to practise anything.

Samśaya-doubt. There are primarily three types of doubts- doubt in oneself, in the Guru and doubt in the technique. These three can clog one's progress.

When you doubt yourself, you wonder if you are good enough. You feel that you cannot do what is required to be done. You might see that everyone else, except you, is meditating in a blissful state. You feel that it is just you who is suffering and that you are no good. You do not think that you can ever make it.

And then doubts arise about the techniques. You feel that they might not do you any good, that you should try some other techniques.

Next, doubts arise about the teacher. These three types of doubts can hamper progress on the path.

Your doubt is always about something that is positive. You never doubt the negative. You never wonder if you are really depressed but you will certainly doubt your happiness. You wonder if you are happy; if what you wanted is really making you happy. Doubt is the third obstacle.

It is detrimental to anyone's progress. So, doubt has to be done away with. When you are doubtful, that means your prāņa is low. When your energy is high, you do not get doubts.

Pramāda-doing something wrong willfully; doing it with some motive is pramāda. You know that a certain thing is not good for you. Despite that, you continue with it because the mind feels it is going to get some joy out of it. Conversely, you know that something needs to be done but you do not do it. For instance, you know very well that you have to pay tax but you don't pay it. Suppose you are sick and should not eat ice-cream, not overeat, yet you do so. Someone has diabetes and should not eat sugar but they still go on eating sweets or chocolates. Being careless, not being alert and attentive is another obstacle. This is pramāda.

Ālasya-laziness. It is the biggest enemy of mankind. You may be very active but when it comes to doing āsanas, exercises or prāņā yāma, you feel lazy and do not practise them. That laziness can spread to any aspect of your life. You may intentionally not do something.

Avirati-inability to let go of cravings, to contain the senses; to be obsessed with sensual objects and not let go of them. When you are hungry, you eat some food but after your stomach is full, there is no point in thinking about food the whole day.

It is the same when you see a beautiful place. Once you see it, your want should subside. You should not go on thinking about seeing a beautiful place all the time. The same applies to sex. You have had sex and it is over. You do not carry sex in your head twenty-four hours. People see blue-movies day and night. The body is incapable of functioning and mind is obsessed with thoughts of sex. Even old people have this problem. They are seventy, eighty, ninety years old, but they are still thinking about sex. All the actions of the sense organs should be limited to some time. But thinking about something and being feverish about it all the time is avirati, obsession or non-detachment.

Avirati is a big obstruction in the path of yoga, for it does not allow you to get centered. It just pulls you down and keeps you from moving on.

Bhrāntidarśana-delusion, hallucination. You build a castle which does not exist. You create an image about yourself. You imagine that you are somebody special. Suddenly you think that you are a superstar. This is a problem with many people. Many seekers experience visions after practising for a while. They get caught up in that vision because that vision is neither completely false, nor completely true. It is a mixture of some truth, and some falsehood. So people try to hold on to it.

Many cults have been formed because of bhrāntidarśana. People have never really understood the obstacles that can come up in the path of yoga. This is called yoga māya. Yoga māya is a vision that brings an intuitive message. You may be meditating and get an intuitive thought to open the door because somebody is outside the door and when you open the door, you really find that person waiting outside. You get very excited and think that God has told you about it. This will happen again and again because you are not completely hollow and empty. There are residues or traces of desires, hatred, and fears within you. These ideas will come through the form in which you see God or your Guru or through someone else. It will give you ideas which make you suffer. This happened to one of our devotees. She had various visions and most of them happened. She had one vision which indicated that she should not take her husband to the doctor; he would be cured without one. She was already apprehensive about going to a doctor and averse to allopathic medicine. When she had her vision, she became determined not to go to the doctor. Her husband's blood sugar level shot up and due to lack of treatment he lost his eyesight. The devotee became very angry, feeling that her inner voice had deceived her. This happened because of a lack of proper understanding. Most of the factors were alright; there was no impurity in them. But then her own fears and cravings influenced her intuitive thoughts with unpleasant results. This is an obstruction. That is why we should not gallop on the horses of delusions-bhrāntidarśana. Many people get trapped in it. Your imagination about others can also cause tremendous negativity in your mind. You keep chewing on it and are stuck with it. Delusions, fear, anxiety, megalomania are all part of bhrāntidarśana.

Alabdha-bhūmikatva-inability to attain any state on the path, a state of samādhi, peace, or tranquility. Sometimes people feel that they have been doing various practices for many years but do not seem to be getting anywhere. They feel that they are just sitting and nothing is happening. Their mind is crowded with thoughts and they have not attained any state. They feel completely stuck and think that they are getting nowhere. This state of non-attainment of any state is the eighth obstruction. Despite these thoughts, they do not give up the practice. However, they feel stuck without any progress.

       Anavasthitatva-inability to hold on to any state. You have spurts of devotion but you are unable to hold on to it. Some moments of peace and joy come up but you are unable to hold on to it. You are generous, but those few moments of generosity, broad mindedness in your life, simply disappear in a few minutes or seconds. This is the inability to stay in that state. You become very positive, but that positivity lasts only for a few minutes or only as long as you don't see your opponent. The moment you see your opponent, all your positivity is gone with the wind. Someone makes a comment about you and that pricks you deeply. All your equanimity, tranquility, joy, happiness, everything disappears. These are the nine obstacles.

duhkha-daurmanasya-ańgamejayatva-śvāsa-praśvāsā

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>vikşepa-sahabhuvah || 31 ||</span>

दुःखदौर्मनस्याङ्गमेजयत्वश्वासप्रश्वासा विक्षेपसहभुवः ॥ ३१॥

Sorrow, bitterness, lack of control of the body, and imbalance in breathing manifest along with the distractions.

So, what comes along with the obstacles?

Dukha-pain in the body and mind.

Daurmanasya-bitterness in the mind which comes from the obstacles in one's life. Duḥkha or sadness gives way to bitterness, daurmanasya. You do not feel good with anybody. There is bitterness for others and oneself.

Bitterness, dejection, depression are the by-products of the nine obstacles.  

Angamejayatva-restlessness and inability to control your body. It means that your body is not obeying you and behaving like a drunkard. A drunkard wants to go to the left but his body goes to the right. He wants to walk straight but his body goes elsewhere. He tries to reach for his glass but goes on putting his hand on the table away from the glass. This lack of coordination between the body and the mind is angamejayatva. The body does not listen to you. You want to walk but the body does not move.

Śvāsapraśvāsāḥ vikşepa-your breath is irregular, unsettled, shaky and uncomfortable. Have you observed the breath of frustrated people? Their inhalation is staggered and exhalation is also not normal; this indicates vikşepa. Vikşepa means the disturbed state of mind or wrong perception of reality.

When you are disturbed, if you observe the incoming and outgoing breath, you will notice that there is a complete imbalance. You often let out a big sigh, when you are unhappy, indicating heaviness and sadness. When you are happy or excited the incoming breath is longer and you are more aware of it. It is more prominent.
