Now, the discipline of yoga.

When you say 'Now', it means that you must have prepared yourself prior to this. For yoga to happen, you must have a certain standard of understanding, certain knowledge. Only then can you say, "Now let's embark on yoga."

Atha (now) is a very auspicious word. What happens when you snap your fingers and say, 'Now'? You suddenly become alert. Your mind is right here. When you say 'Now', the presence of mind is created right away. For a student to learn something, first of all, a presence of mind is needed and that moment is very auspicious.
Before beginning or learning anything, the ancient people performed the mangalācharana (an auspicious step), which brings the mind to the present moment- Now! It also implies that you are prepared; ready to learn, and have the inclination to walk on this path. When you have the right teacher, at the right time, then you can say, "Now, let us begin."

Anuśāsanam-let us now talk about the discipline of yoga.
Śāsana means to rule; the rules that society or somebody else imposes on you.
Anuśāsana means self-discipline. Yoga is not an imposition but a discipline that you take on willingly; rules that you impose on yourself.

        Now,<span className='font-bold'> why is yoga called a discipline? </span>

<span className='font-bold'>When does the need for discipline arise?</span>

When you are thirsty, you want to drink water. You do not feel that it is a rule to drink water when you are thirsty. When you are hungry you eat, you don't feel that you need to have discipline for eating when you are hungry. You don't need discipline to enjoy nature. No discipline is necessary for enjoyment. A child never says that it has the discipline to run to its mother when s/he sees her.

When is discipline relevant? When something is not enjoyable. Discipline arises when something is not very charming to begin with, but you know that it would ultimately result in something good and enjoyable.

       A diabetic exercises discipline when it comes to eating sugar. Someone with cholesterol has to be disciplined about not consuming too much fat. This is because though fats may be tasty, unpleasant complications may arise later.

When you are in joy, or at peace, or truly happy, then you are already in the Self. No discipline is needed there. But when it is not so and the mind wags its tail, discipline is essential to calm it down so that it can come back to the Self. The fruit of this process is eventually bliss and happiness.

        There are three types of happiness-sättvika, tāmasika and rājasika.

Sättvika happiness is not so enjoyable to begin with, but it eventually leads to joy. That happiness which is felt after a certain discipline is sättvika.

Discipline is necessary to enjoy this authentic, sättvika happiness. The purpose of discipline is to attain joy, not to torture oneself unnecessarily.

Rājasika happiness appears very enjoyable in the beginning but ends up in misery and suffering. It is caused by following the wrong discipline. It may also arise from a lack of discipline.

Sometimes people impose a discipline on themselves which does not give them or anybody else any joy at any time. This is tāmasika happiness. Tāmasika happiness is not happiness at all; it is just misery from the beginning to the end.

        That is why Maharși Patanjali began with 'Now', when things are not clear and when your heart is not in the right place.

Yoga anuśāsanam-nobody has imposed the discipline of yoga on you. It is self-imposed. What are the rules that you have imposed on yourself? When you wake up in the morning, you brush your teeth. You do it before going to bed too. This is your discipline. But this has been imposed on you from childhood. When you were a child, your mother or father imposed it on you. Once it became a habit and you understood that it was good for you, it was no longer their rule. It became 'your' rule . Keeping yourself clean and observing hygiene, exercising, meditating, being kind, considerate, and not being rude-all these rules that you have imposed on yourself are your discipline.

What does this discipline of yoga do? It is the discipline to unite yourself; unite all the loose ends of your existence.
