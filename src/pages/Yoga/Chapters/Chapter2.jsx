योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः ॥ २॥

Yoga is restraining the modulations of consciousness.

yogaścitta-vrtti-nirodhah

Yoga is having a say over the modulations or vrttis ( tendencies) of the mind.

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Then (when the modulations of consciousness are restrained) the seer abides in the nature of the seer.
What happens when you have a say over the modulations of the mind? You get established in the seer. The nature of the seer is different from that of the scenery. When you are caught in the modulations of the mind, you are lost in the scenery. But in yoga, what do you do? You bring your attention back to yourself, back from the scenery to the seer. When you have a say over the modulations of the mind, you repose in the nature of the seer, in the nature of the Self. Otherwise, what has been happening?

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>vrtti-sarūpyam itaratra || 4 ||

वृत्तिसारूप्यम् इतरत्र ॥ ४॥</span>

At other times (other than when Yoga happens), (the seer) identifies with the modulations of the mind.
When you are not in the Self, your mind is engrossed in the modulations. It is engaged in the outside world all the time. Your eyes are open and you are caught up in all that you see. Similarly, you are caught up in all that you smell, hear, touch and taste. When you are awake, you are constantly engaged in the activities of the senses, and when you go back to the sleep and dream states, you are completely shut off. Even in the sleep and dream states, the same memories come up. So, you are never calm and quiet. When you unite all the loose ends of your existence, your perception is not turned outside; 'you' become the object of your perception.

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        When simple people or children watch a movie, they become totally involved in it. At that time, nothing else exists but the movie. When you have a backache or pain in your legs, it seems more intense if you are idle. But when you are engaged in watching a movie, then you do not feel the pain. You do not feel your body at all; you are not even aware that you are sitting. That is the intense interest the movie has kindled in you. Your consciousness has assumed the form of that movie, of that vrtti.

Once people were watching a movie in a village. They saw that the hero was being tortured by the villain. The audience actually rushed towards the screen with sticks and stones to hit the villain.

Our consciousness assumes the form of the vrtti.

The purpose of yoga is to bring integrity in you and complete you, make you whole. You are looking at this book. Now become aware of your eyes which are looking at the book. Become aware of the mind that is looking through those eyes. Now, for a moment, close your eyes. Just squeeze them. Feel your eyes and take your attention from the eyes to the mind, that is all over your head. Now, become aware of your whole body, your heart and the very core of your existence- the 'I' that is you. Rest and relax there, right there. You realize that you are not interested in seeing, smelling, hearing, tasting, feeling or touching anything. Retrieve your mind from all the five senses to the core of your existence.

Abiding in the nature of the seer is yoga. Whenever you experience joy, ecstasy, bliss, or happiness in life, knowingly or unknowingly, you are abiding in the nature of the seer. At other times, you are involved in the different activities of your mind.

You assume the form of the modulation in the mind. What are the activities in the mind?

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        
These modulations are of five types, which could express themselves as problematic or non-problematic
There are certain vrttis that cause trouble or difficulties and there are others that do not. These are the five modulations of the mind. What are they?

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>pramāņa-viparyaya-vikalpa-nidrā-smrtayah || 6 ||

प्रमाणविपर्ययविकल्पनिद्रास्मृतयः ॥ ६॥ </span>

Wanting proof, incorrect understanding, delusion, sleep and dwelling in the memory (are the five types of modulations).
There are five modulations of the mind in which the seer is lost. What are the modulations?

Pramāņa-proof. The mind wants proof for everything. It seeks proof of your perception; your understanding of an object.

Viparyaya-wrong perception; a perception which is different from reality.

Vikalpa-imagination, delusion; that which you have imagined does not exist at all.

Nidrā-sleep.

Smrti-memory.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>pratyaksa-anumāna-agamāḥ pramānāni || 7 ||

प्रत्यक्षानुमानागमाः प्रमाणानि ॥ ७॥</span>

Proof is sought in three ways-through experiential, inferred or reliable sources.
In the waking state of consciousness, we want proof for everything.

Pratyaksa-the first kind of proof is a direct experience. Our mind constantly wants some obvious, solid experiential proof.

Anumāna-the second kind is an inference, a guess. When there is smoke you infer that there was a fire. You have not seen the fire, but the smoke indicates that there must have been a fire.

Agama-the third kind is the proof that is found in the scriptures. When you find a bottle labeled 'Poison', you will not say, "No, I don't believe it! I want to test it first." You can't taste it. You can't say, "I want proof, I want to personally experience it." How can you experience poison? You have to accept what is written on the bottle as proof of the truth.

Materia Medica tells us about combinations of herbs that are good to treat diseases. Since all of this is written in the materia medica, we accept it as proof.

      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        

You cannot acquire all the knowledge which has been accumulated over centuries in the scriptures in one lifetime. You read about a war in a history book, you can't say, "No! I don't believe in the book. I want to see whether the World War really happened. How do I know? I was not there then." You were not there but you have to believe the documentation that is available. This is āgama. Pratyaksa, anumāna, and āgama-these three types of perception or understanding of proof verify whether what you know is correct or not.

Yoga happens when you drop this tendency. Then alone can you abide in the Self. Retrieving from this activity of the mind-of wanting proof-is being released from that tendency and going back to the Self. You may need proof of whether you are in Switzerland or not through your senses. But you do not need proof to know whether you are 'here' or not through your senses. This is a very subtle point! You could be taken to Austria or even somewhere in Canada. You will see similar snowy mountains and lakes there. You may think that you are in Switzerland but you are not. Your senses may fool you. But the feeling of 'I am' and 'I exist ' is beyond proof.

Abiding in the Self does not need proof. Truth cannot be understood through proof. Anything that can be proved can also be disproved. Truth is beyond proof or disproof. God is beyond proof. You can neither prove nor disprove God.

Proof is connected with logic and logic is very limited in its purview. It is the same with enlightenment and with love. Love cannot be proved or disproved. Someone's actions or behaviour is not proof of love. Many movie actors and actresses exhibit a lot of love and romance in their movies without actually experiencing real love or romance. One can act the emotion of love very well without feeling it or living it.

Proof is one of the main things that you are stuck with in this world; you want proof for everything. This is not in the realm of the seer. The seer is beyond proof.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>viparyayo mithyā-jñānam atadrūpa-pratistham || 8 ||

विपर्ययो मिथ्याज्ञानम् अतद्रूपप्रतिष्ठम् ॥ ८॥</span>

Incorrect understanding is when there is a gap between perception and reality. 


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        
Viparyaya is wrong understanding. You are stuck in your mind due to a wrong perception.

viparyayo mithyā jñānam atadrūpa pratistham

Things are not the way you think they are. You perceive things wrongly. Most of the time you impose your own views, ideas, and feelings on others. You think that this is how things are but they are not actually so.

You may have an inferiority complex, and thereby consider someone's behaviour to be very arrogant. Actually they are not arrogant, and you are not being ill -treated by them. But you feel that you are being ill- treated. You feel that you have not been respected. It is because you do not respect yourself enough that you think that others do not respect you. This tendency of your mind is viparyaya.

A good friend of yours suddenly starts being rude to you, and you wonder what has happened to them.
You wonder what it is that you have done to cause this.
You do not understand that they are imagining things about you in their minds. It is not because they are bad or any such thing. It is this activity of the citta, of the mind, that is predominant at that time.
Suddenly, people may feel that they are not being loved.
Many parents have this problem with their children. They get so perplexed! They do not know what to do and how to prove their love to their children.

Proof is of no importance once viparyaya dominates. Pramāņa does not survive, and logic fails because the mind is now more active in the second modulation, the second vrtti-viparyaya. Correct knowledge appears briefly somewhere in the mind but returns to the background again and wrong information-viparyaya sticks on.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>śabda-jñāna-anupātī vastu-śūnyo vikalpah || 9 ||

शब्दज्ञानानुपाती वस्तुशून्यो विकल्पः ॥ ९॥</span>

Where there are no objects corresponding to words and ideas in the mind, it is called imagination.
Vikalpa is a total delusion of the mind. It is not wrong knowledge that the mind is stuck in but in total imagination. Two of the very common examples that have been given by the masters of yore are 'The lotus flower in the sky' and 'The horns of a rabbit'. Rabbits do not have horns. A horn is true, a rabbit is true, but when you say a rabbit has horns-this is vikalpa. A flower is true, the sky is true, but if you think the flower is in the sky, it is a delusion.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        
Vikalpa could be of two types. One could be just a joyful and pleasurable fantasy, and the other could be a baseless fear. Even fear is a vikalpa. You may be apprehensive about what will happen if you die the next day. You imagine that you've met with an accident and have become disabled. These are all just thoughts that have no basis. Baseless fears in the mind or fantasies are called vikalpa.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>abhāva-pratyaya-alambanā vịttih-nidrā || 10 ||

अभावप्रत्ययालम्बना वृत्तिर्निद्रा ॥ १०॥</span>

Sleep is when the mind embraces emptiness.
No one else has ever defined sleep in such a beautiful manner! When the mind has no content, it gets into a state called sleep.

abhāva pratyaya ālambanā vịttir nidrā

Sleep is that modulation of the mind in which it takes recourse to a content-less state.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>anubhūta-vişaya-asampramosah smrtih || 11 ||

अनुभूतविषयासंप्रमोषः स्मृतिः ॥ ११ ॥</span>

Memory is the inability to let go of past experiences.

Smrti means those experiences that your mind could not let go of. Every morning you brush your teeth, you have breakfast, but that doesn't remain in your mind as a memory. Do you remember what breakfast you had the day before yesterday? One week ago? Last month? Can you tell me what clothes you wore on December 31 st or on November 30th? Do you remember? No! Because these details are not important. These acts were neither pleasurable nor painful, so they didn't make an impact on the consciousness. When you are unable to let go of some experience that you have had, it remains as a memory.
Pleasant experiences create cravings and unpleasant experiences create fear and trauma in the mind. This is what memory is all about.

When you are awake, are you in any of these four modulations (pramāņa, viparyaya, vikalpa, smrti)? Then , that is not meditation. That is not yoga.



      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        
Are you looking for some proof? Are you debating with yourself? Are you hanging on to wrong knowledge or concepts about things? You do not know how things are because the whole world is fluid. There is nothing fixed here-neither people's minds nor their thoughts. Go one step further, and you can say that anything can change any time, in any manner. The whole world is a field of all possibilities. But your mind fixes things, people, ideas, places, everything into definite items, quantities. It quantifies them, "This is how it is," with the use of:
i) proof
ii) wrong information
iii) vikalpa, fantasies or fears
iv) by dwelling in the past experiences

These four modulations and sleep, the fifth modulation , are the five different vrttis of the mind.
These five vrttis are not bad. It is not that they should not be there.

yogaścitta vrtti nirodhah

These vrittis are klişţa aklişţa-some are difficult, some are not. Some are painful and some are not. If you do not get sleep, it is painful. If you sleep too much, even then, it is painful. Isn't it? If you forget everything and can't remember anything, it is painful. At the same time if you cannot forget anything, that too is painful.

Similarly, proof can be painful and it can be without pain also. Perhaps, that is why there is a proverb in English, 'Ignorance is bliss!' You do not know something, and you are blissful but when you get the proof, the truth can be hard-hitting and painful. However, the truth need not always be painful.

viparyayo mithyā jñānam

When you are ignorant, you remain in your own little world and it may be comforting for a while but wrong understanding is really painful eventually.

Vikalpa (imagination) can be pleasurable. You imagine that you have become an angel with wings and are flying around in the sky. But if you imagine that everybody is against you and out to get you, it is very painful. Your imagination could be painful or without pain.

These five vrttis are indispensable but if they are not in your control then you can never come back to the Self. So, to understand the nature of the seer, we must have a say over these five modulations of the mind.
Now, how to do this? How will you get over the overpowering nature of these vrttis? Maharși Patañjali is going to tell us now.
