तत्प्रतिषेधार्थम् एकतत्त्वाभ्यासः ॥ ३२॥

To counter these (obstacles) practice one principle.
</span>

<span>How do you get over the obstacles? </span> By practicing one pointedness , holding onto one principle.

Which principle? It could be Om. Maharși Patañjali asks to chant Om and feel it. Om has many meanings-purity, clarity and sincerity, not just one. Om is the essence of creation. It is unconditional love. Om is everything, and the true name is Om. Put your attention on the one principle, one Divinity, one non- changing, eternal, blissful consciousness.

There are many ways to look at that one Principle. Within one, there is diversity. One principle could mean that you just focus on the air element or fire or the earth element. Know that this body is the earth element that goes back to the Earth. The earth element has all the other elements in it.

The one tattva could be the Śiva principle or the Guru principle- nothing other than the Guru. What happens when you keep doing one thing? Boredom arises, restlessness will surface. That restlessness and boredom take you to a peak that brings clarity. This is the only way out. Our mind is troubled because it is dwelling on duality. It has innumerable choices and is further confused. It wonders if it should do this or that. Then it jumps all over the place and gets further divided. A divided mind is misery and a one-pointed mind is joy.

In all those moments when you have been very happy, you experienced life itself in totality. If you notice what happiness is, it is the mind becoming one whole. It becomes so total and then you experience joy, peace, and bliss.

Duality, or a divided mind, is the cause of fear and misery. If you keep doing two things or too many things, it is not eka-tattva-abhyāsaḥ; it is not one practice.

What is eka-tattva? It is attending to one principle. This one principle could be God, could be matter, could be Guru or the Self. It could be anything but you need to practise just that one thing -eka-tattva-abhyāsaḥ.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       You can attend to one principle only if there is a certain degree of calmness and subtleness in the mind. Otherwise, that does not seem possible. 
You see that One Principle in everybody.

'It is the Self that is present everywhere.'

'It is my Master who is present everywhere. There is nobody other than my Master. He is everything for me.'

'God is everything for me.'

'It is all me only. There is nothing other than me.'

This is the skill in life-holding on to one principle and seeing that principle in everything.

Our life has to be lived in the realm of multiplicity. In the world, you live with many people and everybody is not the same. But how can you see the same thing in everybody? Nothing appears to be the same. No two people appear to be the same. But here, Patañjali says, "See one thing in every one. Focus on that one principle. Then, you get over all the obstacles."

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>maitrī-karuņā-mudita-upekşāņām sukha-duḥkha-punya-apunya- vişayāņāmbhāvanātaḥ-citta-prasādanam || 33 ||

मैत्रीकरुणामुदितोपेक्षाणां सुखदुः खपुण्यापुण्यविषयाणांभावनातश्चित्तप्रसादनम् ॥ ३३॥</span>

We attain a pleasant state of mind by cultivating feelings of friendliness towards those who are happy, compassion for those who are suffering, goodwill towards those who are virtuous, and indifference towards the unethical.

How to keep the pleasantness of the mind? It is not that there are only good and happy people in society but all kinds. There is misery in the world, there is joy, there are both good and bad things in the world. How do you deal with all of them? What is the attitude you should have? Here, Maharși Patañjali gives you a great formula:

maitrī-karuņā-muditā-upekşāņām-sukha-duhkha-punya- apunya-viṣayāņām bhāvanātaḥ-citta-prasādanam

For your consciousness to be pleasant, to be in a state of equanimity, what do you need? You need to have four kinds of attitude.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
      Maitrī-friendliness. Towards those who are happy. If your friends are happy, don't you feel happy? If you don't feel happy with your friends, that means they are not your friends. If you're not friendly with happy people, you will become jealous of them. You are jealous of people who are happier than you. But if you feel that they belong to you, it does not bother you when they are happy. You are never jealous about the happiness of someone very close and dear to you. Jealousy arises when the happy person is not connected to you totally. It might be difficult in the beginning to feel the connection. Intellectually you may feel that it is only you who is in the other person but your feelings still have their preferences since they are not fully cultured and established in the Self. So, friendship with those who are happy will help you get over jealousy.

Karuņā-compassion. Towards those who are suffering, have compassion, not friendliness. This is a secret! Don't be friendly with them because this friendship will drag you down and make you unhappy too. Then you will be unable to help them. You might think that you should share the unhappiness of your friend but then, you will not be able to share your happiness with them. So, you should not be friendly with unhappy people but be compassionate with them. There is a difference here. Karuņā is compassion. If someone is suffering, they are suffering because of their karma. Be compassionate to them, not friendly. If you do not know how to deal with people who are suffering, you make their beliefs, that God has been unjust with them and that nature has been unkind to them, stronger.

When you agree with them that they are suffering, you push them lower down. Actually, you should be trying to pull them out of the rut they have pushed themselves into. Instead, you do the opposite and you do it unconsciously.

You should not pity people who are suffering. There is a big

difference between pity and compassion. When you pity a person

you push him further down. With pity, you make the belief of the suffering person, about his sorrow, more concrete. If someone thinks that a great injustice has been done to them and they are on a self-pitying trip, you are not helping them in any way if you pity them too. You will not help them in any way to wake up to the truth. You should have compassion and not friendliness, for people who are suffering.

In many āśramas, if someone is unhappy or negative, everybody ostracises them. Nobody talks to them, in order to avoid their negativity. The scriptures also tell you not to sit with one who has too many doubts-doubt about the practice, about the Guru, about knowledge. If you sit with them, you will also go down with them. Their energy is low and they will pull your energy down also. In Hindi there is a saying, don't even shake hands with those who are negative about the path, about the knowledge, about the Master. Because those negative vibrations will come to you and that is considered a sin. In ancient days if someone said something negative, people would close their ears and start chanting, "Śiva-Śiva-Śiva-Śiva let my ears not hear these sort of things. Let me plug my ears because it is going to destroy my own consciousness."

      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       Muditā-feel happy for those doing good work. You should become one with them and feel that you are doing a good job with them. Then, the sense of competition disappears, anger and jealousy subside. The tendency of finding fault with people who are doing good things will disappear.

The people who complain would not have done much themselves Criticism comes from people who do not work. You should not find fault with people who are doing good work. You can do this only when you become one with them. Muditā means happiness for people who are doing a wonderful job. Share the happiness, feel happy.

Upekşā-just be indifferent to the people who say or do negative things. If somebody says something which is not true, just brush it off. It is not even worth thinking about. But you do the reverse. You do not think of people who are doing meritorious work. Instead of ignoring people who do sinful things, you keep on thinking about them.

So, when you see people doing sinful things, you should educate them and then ignore them.

You educate out of compassion and then ignore. Otherwise, you

will think about their actions and get bothered. You may think they're imperfect. If you go on thinking so, you will become imperfect. Then, you will become like them, maybe even worse.

Secondly, you think that the other person is wrong and you are right. If you look honestly at yourself, you will realise that you may be wrong too. If you point an accusing finger at somebody, then there are three fingers always pointing at you. But if you stop differentiating between yourself and others, then you can just turn inward.

If you keep these four attitudes in your mind, your mind will blossom-cittaprasādanam. Grace will dawn in your mind.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>pracchardana-vidhāraņābhyām vā prāņasya || 34 ||

प्रच्छर्दनविधारणाभ्यां वा प्राणस्य ॥ ३४॥</span>

Or by breaking and elongating the flow of prāņa.

The mind is also calmed by regulating the breath, particularly attending to exhalation and the natural stilling of breath. By consciously changing the pattern of breath and holding the breath, the state of mind can be changed. Bhastrikā, prāņāyāma and Sudarśana Kriyā are all an indication of pracchardana.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       Patañjali has not mentioned Sudarśana Kriyā directly. But in this sentence, there is a clue. You can trace our practices to that one sutra. We are not just breathing any way we like. We are consciously breathing in a definite rhythm. That is pracchhardana -splitting. We are splitting the breath, dividing it and holding it with different rhythms.

That is pracchardana-vidhāraņābhyām vā prāņasya.

We are modulating the prāņa and the breath. This also makes our mind focused.

vişayavatī vā pravrttih-utpannā manasaḥ sthiti-nibandhini || 35 |

विषयवती वा प्रवृत्तिरुत्पन्ना मनसः स्थितिनिबन्धिनी ॥ ३५॥

Or by arresting (holding) the mind in that state which arises through contact with the sense objects.

If your mind is engrossed in any of the five senses, through that also you can attain samādhi. Here Maharși Patañjali gives a clue of Vijñāna Bhairava. In the Vijñāna Bhairava, Śiva tells us that through sight, sound, smell, taste and touch; through all these five senses, you can enter into the state of Bhairava, the higher consciousness.

What happens in the eye-gazing process, during the Advanced Meditation Course (The Art of Living Silence Retreat)? You look at somebody for a few minutes, you gaze at that person from the bottom of your heart. At that time, your mind does not run here and there. The mind comes to a standstill and is completely settled.

Here Maharși Patañjali says that by paying attention to any of the five senses, your consciousness can perceive subtle sensory experiences. It's not just the gross sensory experiences. In the state of sleep, you are experiencing all the five senses but in a subtle way. You are not using your eyes, you are not using your ears but in the deep state of sleep or dream, you are experiencing them.

For example, if you see a baby eating a lollipop, it is totally engrossed in it. It is very different from the way you eat food. A bird chirping is totally into chirping and it does only that at that time. When it does other activities, it does not chirp. Similarly, if you put your 100% attention on any one of the senses, that also brings stability in the consciousness, stability in the mind.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>viśokā vā jyotişmatī || 36 ||

विशोका वा ज्योतिष्मती ॥ ३६॥

Or by the sorrowless state attained through the glowing intellect.</span>

If you are, even for a few moments, with a person who is very unhappy and sad, then you also start feeling depressed. And if you are with someone who is very joyful and is bubbling with joy and enthusiasm, then you start feeling joyful too. You have trained your mind to be happy or unhappy. If you have acquired the habit of being unhappy, then it becomes your second nature. You feel at home having a long face all the time.

      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Viśokā vā jyotişmatī-when you focus on a state which is devoid of sadness or sorrow then the effulgent intellect dawns within you.

Viśokā means getting rid of unhappiness. Feeling sad is just a habit. If you look into your mind and see that the sadness is simply unfounded and self-generated, it will disappear and you will become free of it. It is just a concept. It is baseless. You may feel that you are not smart enough; nobody cares for you, people do not respect you. Why should you think so? All these self- imposed ideas make you unhappy. Your comparisons can disturb you and make you sad. Do not compare yourself with anybody. You should feel that you can be happier than you are now. Make your mind free of sadness which is born out of your concepts.

Jyotişmatīprajñā-consider your mind as light, as a flame. Your consciousness is a flame. Your entire body is functioning because of the presence of the mind as a flame in you. Otherwise, you will be like an unlit candle.

How does a flame work? A flame burns because of oxygen. There is a combination of matter and oxygen and a flame comes into being.

What is life? Life is also the same. It uses oxygen and lives on some matter. Just as a flame lives on wax, the wick and oxygen, your life and the mind uses the body and the food in the body as wax. The air is like the oxygen and exhibits activities in the body just as the flame exhibits its activity.

Life and light are very similar. If you put a bottle over a burning candle, it will be extinguished in a few moments. Similarly, if you are shut in a room, without any windows, you can live only for a few hours due to the lack of oxygen. If you do to your body what you do to the candle, the reaction will be the same. If you put more wax into the candle, it will burn for a longer period.

Similarly, if you put food into your body, then it will live longer. If the wick is burnt out, no amount of wax will make the candle burn. The wick has its own limitation. Similarly, no amount of food will sustain the body after some years of life. The body functions just like the wick. This body is holding on to the jyotişmatīprajñā.

Viśokā vā jyotişmatī-get rid of unhappiness and be happy. At the same time know that your mind is made up of light and not matter. Your mind is energy. You ARE energy.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>vītarāga-vişayam vā cittam || 37 ||

विशोका वा ज्योतिष्मती ॥ ३६॥

Or by remembering the one who is devoid of craving.</span>

Your mind is like water. I said earlier that your mind is like a flame . I tell you, your mind is also like water. Just as water assumes the shape of its container, your mind becomes like the thought you engage in.

Vītarāga-one who is liberated from cravings. If you think of such a person, then your mind also gets those qualities. It develops all the qualities of whatever thoughts you put into it.

      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       Putting your attention on the enlightened, on a saint, on one whose mind is still, your mind becomes stable and you attain samādhi. This is the principle that is used by Jains and Buddhists. The Hindu philosophy asks to put the attention on the Guru, on the Buddha, on the Jain tīrthankara, one who is still, who is just there. Whomsoever you think of, your mind assumes their state. If you think of a person who is agitated or negative, your mind assumes that agitation. If you think of a calm person, your mind also begins to develop those qualities. It starts feeling that peace and that quietness. This is because the mind is also like air. Air does not have a location. It is not just fixed anywhere. The cool breeze, that energy enters your system.

The mind is also like ether because it is all permeating. Your consciousness is like ether, all-pervading.

But if you have rāga and dveşa (craving and aversion) with someone who is vītarāga, then it defeats the purpose. That is why they say not to see a Guru or an enlightened person as a human being, as a person with likes and dislikes. Otherwise, your mind goes on a big trip, "What will they like? What will they not? Why this and not that?" Instead, see them as pure consciousness, as peace, as joy. Then, you also start radiating these. But even if any thoughts come or likes and dislikes arise, do not struggle with them, "I shouldn't think that." Just let go and relax.

It is very simple. When you think of someone who is without craving, then immediately you draw on that energy and assume that form. You should try this on your own and experiment. Just think of somebody nasty and you will begin to feel nasty emotions inside. If you think of somebody who is jealous of you, you will feel uncomfortable. If you think of somebody who is into drugs, alcohol and who is very miserable, then you will feel all these knots coming up in your body, in your system. Think of somebody whom you love very much, and you will have nice feelings and sensations arise in you.

If you think of the enlightened, your consciousness becomes more and more alive and filled with light. That is why Jesus said, " If you have to go to my Father, you have to go through me. There is no other way." You have to go through the Master, because the Master is an example right there. You have to pass through your mind. And what can help? The doorway with those vibrations and sensations. And these vibrations and sensations manifest in that body where the citta is vītarāga, fully blossomed, without any hindrances.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>svapna-nidrā-jñāna-ālambanam vā || 38 ||

स्वप्ननिद्राज्ञानालम्बनं वा ॥३८॥

Or through the knowledge of sleep and dreams.</span>

By focusing your attention on sleep you can attain samādhi. We sleep every night but we have never met our sleep. We don't know what sleep is. If you happen to know what sleep is, that very moment you will attain samādhi. When you dream, the dreamer is not there, only the dream is there. But if you realise "I am dreaming", this knowledge of dream and deep sleep can also still your mind.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       
What happens when you sleep? You let go of everything. If you hold on to even one thing, you cannot sleep. In sleep, all your identities disappear. You are neither male nor female, neither rich nor poor, neither stupid nor intelligent; sleep is just sleep.

In sleep, all your likes and dislikes disappear. You cannot carry anybody into your sleep. However dear somebody is, you cannot take them with you in your sleep. In your sleep, you are devoid of all your identities, your cravings, your aversions, etc. You let go of all of them and just rest. You do not do anything.

This is exactly what meditation is-doing nothing. In meditation, you do not do anything even for God or for yourself. You just let go of everything, just as you do when you sleep. The knowledge of sleep leads you to samādhi.

Ignorant people take dreams as the reality and enlightened people see this reality as a dream. Trying to interpret what you saw in your dream is utter ignorance. Enlightenment is to realise that this reality itself is a dream. If you tell an enlightened person about your dreams, he will tell you to forget about them and to wake up. 

However, somebody who does 'dream interpretation' will give you various meanings for your dreams. They will put more ideas in your head. This is ignorance.

There are five types of dreams. The first are those that are the fulfilment of your cravings and your unfulfilled desires. You wanted to have an ice-cream or a pizza but you couldn't. Then, when you are asleep you have a dream in which you are eating a pizza or having a big scoop of ice-cream. You may have wanted to go for a walk with somebody and you could not do it. Then you dream that you are on such a walk. Your latent desires come up in dreams. Desires and fears are seen in dreams.

The second type of dream is when there is some stress being released from the past. Past experiences are seen in such dreams.

The third type is an intuitive dream. It could be about what might happen in the future-an intuition.

The fourth type of dream is a combination of all the three- fulfillment, stress-release and intuitiveness.

And the fifth type of dream has nothing to do with you; it is about the place where you are sleeping. You may be in a hotel in Italy and you dream of the unfamiliar Italian language, and all the unfamiliar sounds that you have been hearing in that country.


      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        So, any of these five types of dreams can occur and you may not be able to categorize your dreams. Usually, it will be the fourth type, which is a combination of all types. Therefore, a wise person will just brush them aside. He will consider a dream to just be that, and nothing more. Even the reality of wakefulness is a dream. You may be in a place on one day and in another the next and in a third the day after. Your presence in a place in the past will seem like a dream.

Similarly, what you are planning to do next week is like a dream right now. Your mind is more in a dream than in wakefulness. You could say that there are only two states of consciousness, not three. One is deep sleep and the other is dreaming-dreaming in the day or in the night. Daydreaming, building castles in the air goes on and on in the mind all the time. But once you know that you are daydreaming, there is a gush of energy in you. You become alert. This alertness wakes you up to reality; you are awakened. This awakening is prajñā. It is samādhi. Only at that moment are you fully alive. Only then are you awake to the truth of what IS. The rest of the time, you are asleep . You wake up even when you know that you have been in deep sleep and dreaming.

      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       Patañjali has done a marvelous thing just quoting this one sūtra. Knowledge of sleep awakens you. This is because when a person is asleep, he is not at all aware of it. The moment he knows that he is sleeping, he is already awake. A person who is daydreaming does not know it. The moment he knows that he is daydreaming, he wakes up to reality instantly. When you do Kriyā and prāņāyā ma and nothing happens to you, you begin to daydream or sleep. There can be only these two possibilities. If you are daydreaming, the prāņāyāma cannot help you because the mind is galloping on a dream, 'I'll be president'. You don't know how much of a headache it is to be president. It is very difficult to get into any sādhanā when the mind is in a constant state of daydreaming. The pity is people do not even know they are daydreaming and their dreams are worth nothing really.

svapna-nidrā jñāna-ālambanam vā

The knowledge of dreams and sleep can also awaken you to the truth.

<span className='font-bold text-lg'>yathā-abhimata-dhyānād vā || 39 ||

यथाभिमतध्यानाद् वा ॥ ३९॥

Or by meditation according to one's liking.</span>
Meditation also happens effortlessly when you put your attention on whatever you like. If you are walking around enjoying the garden, just staying in the garden can still your mind. This is a very important sūtra.

In Indian temples, the deities are dressed up in beautiful clothes, jewellery, flowers, and the like just to capture your mind.

Sometimes, when you have nothing else to do, you just go around window shopping because the mind likes to see things that are charming. Whichever objects charm the mind, put all of them in one place-this was the trick the ancient rşis resorted to, in order to arrest the mind in a place. That is why in temples, all nice food items are served as prasāda and beautiful garments, jewellery, flowers, clothes, and other things adorn the deity and your mind says, "Wow! So beautiful!" Your mind is arrested there and becomes stable. If your mind is still going here and there, it is quietened by the sound of loud bells and drums. Especially during the aarati, beating drums and clanging bells make your mind go blank. When the mind goes blank, that is the time it has access to the infinite energy deep within.

yathā-bhimata-dhyānād-vā

Wherever the mind goes, you arrest it right there and you can go deep into meditation. Does it mean you just flow away with the attractions? Whenever you feel attracted to something, you want to possess it and when you go to possess it, you destroy it. That is not dhyāna, that is bhoga (enjoyment). Yoga is the complete opposite of bhoga. Yoga is appreciation, adoring the beauty, honouring the beauty and staying centered. Do you see what I'm saying? There is a difference. This is not waywardness, doing whatever you want. Maharşi Patañjali says whenever the mind wanders, use that moment to turn inwards and go deep into your origin-drşţā svarūpa-the nature of the seer.
