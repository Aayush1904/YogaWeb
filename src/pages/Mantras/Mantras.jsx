      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
       <span className='font-bold text-yellow-500'>Mantras are sounds, the vibrations of which have a specific and definite effect on the surroundings, both on the physical and the subtle level. The ancient knowledge of how to use different sounds effectively for a wide range of purposes is known as Mantra Shaastra or the Science of Mantras.</span>

       <p className='text-center'><span className='font-bold'>Basic Principles of Chanting Mantras</span></p>
       <br />
<span className='font-bold text-yellow-500'>There are different types of mantras, and the practice of chanting them and how to use them differs as well. Vedic mantras, for example, are to be chanted only in the proper intonation and rhythm, also called svara and chandas. To learn and chant Vedic mantras one needs to be initiated into Gayatri Mantra first, through the Upanayana ceremony. One then has to learn the mantras from a proper teacher, who is well versed in the same. In a similar way there are other types of mantras like Beeja Mantras, which should only be chanted after receiving them from a teacher or Guru through proper initiation.</span>

<br />
<br />
<p className='text-center'><span className='font-bold text-lg'>Mantras for Daily Activities</span></p>
<br />
In the ancient traditions of India, in the Sanatana Dharma, there was a practice of chanting a mantra before any important activity. This practice brought more awareness and sacredness into daily life, and infused even seemingly insignificant activities with a profound purpose and meaning.

<br />
<br />
<p className='text-center'><span className='font-bold text-red-500'>1) MANTRA WHEN WAKING UP</span></p>

<p className='text-center'>

 <br />
 <span className='text-blue-400'>Meaning </span> : Lakshmi resides in the top of my hands (fingers), Saraswati resides in the middle of my hands (palm), and Govinda resides in the base of my hands (palm). Therefore one should look at one’s palms at the start of the day (and meditate on this).
 <br />
<span className='text-blue-400'>Explanation </span>:  This mantra is a prayer to the different Devatas that reside in our hands, to bless us in our endeavors during the day. That Lakshmi may bestow wealth and abundance on us, that Saraswati may bestow wisdom and understanding, and that Govinda (Lord Vishnu) may bless us with good health. However, one can also take this mantra as a reminder that all kinds of wealth, knowledge and wisdom, and good health, are ‘in our hands’, and we should therefore not be idle. It is up to us to act in the proper manner, and put all our effort, to gain the wealth, knowledge and health we aspire to.

Let our life not be a burden for this earth to carry.
